Shaw is fighting the final days of life after being diagnosed with a rare bone cancer. Shaw, from Redhill, Surrey, sent Hamilton a good luck message on Instagram from his hospital bed prior to Sunday's Spanish Grand Prix - which the Mercedes ace won. The youngster has since moved back to his home for his final days. Hamilton described Harry as his "spirit angel" as he dedicated his victory in Barcelona to him.
