A shadowy jihadist group that has targeted Cabo Delgado province since October 2017 briefly halted attacks after Cyclone Kenneth made landfall on April 25, leaving 45 dead and 250,000 affected. Relief teams and United Nations agencies were still searching for survivors and distributing aid when the Islamists returned to action. In less than a month, the insurgents have killed at least 22 people, wounded dozens more and burned hundreds of homes, according to a record kept by AFP. The attacks have increased despite fresh police and military deployments as authorities struggle to prevent the insurgency disrupting voter registration ahead of presidential and legislative elections in October. Islamist fighters have been attacking remote communities in the gas-rich, Muslim-majority northern region since October 2017. But the group's identity and motives remain unclear. "The country is falling victim and we all need to understand the real reasons," President Filipe Nyusi said last week in a rare interview with the privately-owned Canal de Mocambique newspaper. "The defence and security forces are putting their whole resources into this, so we can learn (the insurgents') motivation and who these people are." The government refuses to confirm details of attacks, but AFP tracked the violence via local sources.
