Piotr Wozniacki has been commenting on her current status, insisting she is doing "okay", despite dropping out of the world's top ten since her diagnosis. "Caroline is mentally okay, happy, so I hope she will be ready in the French Open," Piotr Wozniacki said. "I hope that she can play for many more years, she trains well, happy with tennis and so there is no time about retiring. "Her focus is on the French Open. She can achieve many good results again, it all depends on her body. "Sometimes it works this way but from what I understand from the physiotherapist, she will be okay."
