South African-born England-turned international batsman Kevin Pietersen has revealed that he will be supporting England at the World Cup. Pietersen attended Maritzburg College - a famous South African cricketing school in Pietermaritzburg. He went on to play for his province KwaZulu-Natal before making the move to the United Kingdom to play county cricket for Nottinghamshire. Having impressed with his county, Pietersen was selected for England and went on to make 104 Test appearances for his adopted nation, scoring 8 181 Test runs at an average of 47.28. The 38-year-old admitted he has been 'emotionally attached back to SA' in recent years with the work he is doing on preventing rhino extinction, but that England paved the way for him to fulfil a lifelong dream and for that reason he would be supporting England.  --News24--
