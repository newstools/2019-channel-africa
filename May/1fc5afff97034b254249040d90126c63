The bus had left the town of Wajir in the north-east on Sunday night, with more than 60 passengers on board, when it rammed into the stalled trailer on the road between Bangal and Garissa towns, the reports say. The cement-laden trailer ripped the windows and roof of the bus, the reports add. --BBC--
