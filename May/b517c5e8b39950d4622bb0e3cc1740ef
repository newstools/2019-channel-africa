A political activist, Mohamed Al-Zaki, says that unlike Sudan’s earlier revolutions, protests started in the peripheries as opposed to the centre, specifically in the eastern province of the Red Sea and its ports. “Port Sudan is among the first to participate in this revolution. It has a large and inspirational role, along with other states like al-Damazeen and Niyala. We can say that the revolution was launched from the edges of Sudan, and was later transported to the centre. This is opposed to the earlier revolutions, which started first from the centre and then spread to the edges of Sudan,” Al-Zaki added. Workers of the Sea Ports Corporation gathered at the headquarters, assembling outside the building, chanting and waving banners. Sudan’s main protest group called for a general strike on Tuesday saying two late-night negotiation sessions with the military had failed to reach a deal on how to lead the country after the overthrow of former president Omar al-Bashir. Bashir, the former Islamist general under whose rule Sudan was placed on a United States list of sponsors of terrorism, was ousted by the army after months of protests against soaring prices, cash shortages and other economic hardships. --AfricaNews--
