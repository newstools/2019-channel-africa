Witnesses have told AFP news agency that three people were killed. Details are still coming in. Supporters of Yayi took to the streets on Wednesday after he called for the results of Sunday's parliamentary election to be annulled. Later that night, members of Benin's security forces "went against orders" and used "lethal weapons" against opposition protesters, Beninâ€™s interior minister has told French-language broadcaster RFI. But other government members have denied the use of live rounds, according to RFI. Yayi is one of a number of high-profile figures who have challenged the legitimacy of Sunday's parliamentary election, in which no opposition candidates were allowed to take part. Initial results showed turnout was just 23%, a record low. --AFP--
