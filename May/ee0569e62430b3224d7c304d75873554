Teva, the world’s largest generic drug maker, said the settlement “does not establish any wrongdoing on the part of the company” and denied contributing to opioid abuse in Oklahoma. Claims against Teva focused on the branded opioid products Actiq and Fentora as well as generic painkillers it produced. The trial against Israel-based Teva, along with Johnson & Johnson, was set to begin on Tuesday. The lawsuit alleged the companies’ marketing of the painkiller was to blame for the opioid epidemic. In a statement, Janssen Pharmaceuticals Inc, a Johnson & Johnson subsidiary, said it had acted responsibly and was ready for trial. It said it disagreed with what it called Oklahoma’s “overly expansive theories” of public nuisance law, and said they should not apply in this situation. --Reuters--
