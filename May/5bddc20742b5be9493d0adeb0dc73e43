A government minister told the BBC that eight armed men targeted the church in the town of Toulf√© during Mass on Sunday. Earlier this month gunmen killed four people taking part in a Catholic procession just days after a priest and five parishioners were shot dead in a church in the northern town of Dablo. Several jihadist groups have become increasingly active in Burkina Faso frequently attacking villages and towns in the east and the north of the country. Nearly 400 people are reported to have been killed since 2015.  --BBC--
