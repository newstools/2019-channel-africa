In March 11, China became the first country to ground the 737 MAX, a day after a deadly crash of an Ethiopian Airways Boeing 737 MAX that killed all 157 people on board.

"As time passes by, related losses will further increase," the China Air Transport Association said in a statement.

"It's still unknown when the aircraft will return to service."

That followed the crash in 2018 of a Lion Air 737 MAX 8 which killed all 189 people on board.

By the end of June, the Chinese air transport business will have incurred losses totalling $580 million, the association said.

By the end of March, 13 Chinese airlines had grounded a combined 96 Boeing 737 MAX 8 aircraft in their fleets.

The losses were incurred from the grounding of planes already in fleets, and the delayed delivery of planes that had been ordered.

More than 130 additional aircraft were due to be delivered to Chinese airlines in 2018.

Earlier this week, China's three biggest airlines, China Southern, China Eastern and Air China -- were reported to have filed claims seeking compensation from Boeing.

The amounts being sought by the big three were not released.
