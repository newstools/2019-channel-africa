"It's an ill thought-out and badly conceived plan," fumed one source close to Nissan, who did not wish to be identified, in response to the Fiat-Chrysler "50/50" merger proposal that would potentially create the world's third-largest carmaker. It is a bitter pill to swallow for Nissan, which appeared to be completely left in the dark about the project and is already battling falling sales amid reputational damage from the downfall of Ghosn, who is fighting financial misconduct charges. Behind the scenes at the Yokohama-based firm, people believe it could further damage relations with Renault, which is already pushing for a formal merger between the pair against Nissan's wishes. "Nissan appears to be being kept out of the loop, which is unpleasant for Nissan and may create unnecessary distrust of Renault among Nissan people," analyst Satoru Takada at TIW, a Tokyo-based research and consulting firm, told AFP. Putting a brave face on it, Nissan CEO Hiroto Saikawa told reporters on Monday that he was "open to constructive discussions to strengthen the alliance" and the subject will surely be raised in a meeting on Wednesday with Renault boss Jean-Dominique Senard. Nissan and Renault, with headquarters 10 000 kilometres apart and very different histories and cultures, have always been seen as unlikely bedfellows and Ghosn was instrumental in keeping the alliance together. With his downfall after a Nissan-led investigation, the glue bonding the pair since 1999 has been removed and relations have quickly gone downhill. "Renault's top priority is now FCA," said Takada. "For Nissan, the speculated merger is not a plus. With the merger, Nissan's position in the alliance would be relatively lowered and its independence could be flawed." Fiat's offer, which Renault is studying "with interest", shows its Japanese partner that "it is no longer as important in its eyes," relegating it into third place, according to Christopher Richter, analyst at Tokyo-based CLSA. --IOL--
