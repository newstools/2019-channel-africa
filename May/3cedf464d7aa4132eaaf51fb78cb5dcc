Riaz's hostile spell to Australian Shane Watson was one of the highlights of the 2015 World Cup, but the 33-year-old has not played a one-day international since June 2017. Fellow left-arm quick bowler Amir was also initially omitted from Pakistan's World Cup squad before being pencilled in on Monday. "I think this team has the right combination," Afridi said in a video posted on the Pakistan Cricket Board's Twitter feed on Thursday. "The best thing is (that) batting used to be a constant worry for us but our batsmen are now in good form," the former all-rounder said. Pakistan posted 340-plus scores in three of the four completed matches in this month's ODI series in England, even though the hosts prevailed 4-0. In March they had been thrashed 5-0 by Australia in the United Arab Emirates. "We did quite a few experiments with the side. We rested the seniors in the series against Australia, giving chance to youngsters," Afridi said. "Our bowling struggled before the World Cup I think because they lacked experience there. "Now Wahab Riaz, (leg-spinner) Shadab Khan and Mohammad Amir are back and it's a well-balanced team. We should not have any excuse now." Consistency has never been the strong point of an otherwise talented team, but Afridi reckoned a good start could take the 1992 champions all the way to the June 14 final at the Lord's. "It's very important to win the first couple of matches to build a momentum ... Our youngsters are capable of beating any team in the world." "I see Pakistan as one of the teams in the semi-finals and, God willing, I'm confident they'll play the final too ... "Pressure is inevitable in international cricket. It tests a player and his mental strength. But World Cup is also a great opportunity to become a hero with the whole world looking at you."Â
