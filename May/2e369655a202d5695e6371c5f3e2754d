Katambo said that the reduced maize production was largely due to prolonged dry weather. Zambia still had enough maize stocks for human and industrial use until the next harvest next year, Katambo said. The Southern African country had carry-over stocks of maize amounting to 474,515 tonnes from the last season, including more than 300 000 tonnes held in strategic reserves, he said. Zambia had a total of 2.47 million tonnes of maize available, above its total requirement of 1.96 million tonnes, Katambo said. --Reuters--
