Inflation was 6.58% year-on-year in April from 4.35% a month earlier, the Kenya National Bureau of Statistics said. On a month-on-month basis, inflation was 3.51%, up from 1.60% in March. The last time inflation was near this levels was in September 2017, when it stood at 7.06% year-on-year. The food and non-alcoholic index rose 6.86% month-on-month in April from 3.30% the previous month, the bureau said. The index carries a 36.04% weight in the basket of goods used to measure inflation. Kenya’s long rainy season from March till May started late in most of the country, hurting food and other agricultural production. Agriculture accounts for close to a third of Kenya’s annual economic output. The government’s preferred band for inflation is between 2.5 and 7.5% in the medium term. “While we were expecting food and fuel prices to be a source of pressure on inflation, the magnitude of the rise has taken us by surprise,” Razia Khan, the Head of Research for Africa at Standard Chartered Bank in London, said. The Housing, Water, Electricity, Gas and other Fuels Index was up 0.93% month-on-month and 5.78% year-on-year, the statistics office said. The World Bank trimmed its forecast for Kenya’s economic growth in 2019 to 5.7% this month from an earlier forecast of 5.8% because of the delay to the rainy season. President Uhuru Kenyatta however said this month the government expected the economy to grow by 6.3% in 2019. --Reuters--
