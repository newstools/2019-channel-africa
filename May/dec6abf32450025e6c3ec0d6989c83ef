More than 250 people were killed and nearly 500 wounded in a series of attacks claimed by Islamic State on churches and hotels in Sri Lanka on April 21. England is due to play Tests in Colombo and Galle next March but the attacks have led to fears Sri Lanka could join Pakistan as a no-go area for major international sides. Pakistan have been forced to play the bulk of their home games in the United Arab Emirates since 2009, when armed militants targeted Sri Lanka's team bus in Lahore. Sri Lanka great Sangakkara, who will later this year become the first non-British president of Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC), lamented the fact some Pakistan players had never played a Test in their own country and hoped his own nation would not face a similar fate. "I was in the bus in 2009 when the Sri Lanka team got attacked and I understand the reservations and the security concerns that come after such an incident or even as an observer looking from the outside in," Sangakkara told reporters at Lord's on Thursday. "We need a very open conversation with the necessary security aspects that are in place, make sure there are independent assessments done, that the boards connect openly and fully," he added. "We always talk about cricket transcending politics and that has to be the case with tours, as long as security and safety is assured, and there is an honest commitment from every country to put those security measures in place." He said Sri Lanka, which endured a long and bloody civil war until 2009, had managed to host cricket tours, including a World Cup "in very trying circumstances" in the past. Sangakkara was speaking just a week from the start of the World Cup, with hosts England opening the tournament against South Africa on May 30. --News24--
