In a statement, it said the building included "design elements reminiscent of Great Zimbabwe and locally sourced material, such as brick and black granite that reflect our appreciation for Zimbabwe's culture and responsible use of natural resources". Zimbabweâ€™s state-owner Herald newspaper, described the embassy compound, built at a cost of about $300 million, as a "structural behemoth", which was believed to be one of US' largest embassies in Africa. The newspaper added that despite the US continuing to impose "illegal" sanctions on Zimbabwe, the US Ambassador to Harare, Brian Nichols, struck a conciliatory tone at the opening ceremony. He praised the government's efforts to "align" laws with the constitution and promised to strengthen trade and investment ties, the Herald reported. --BBC--
