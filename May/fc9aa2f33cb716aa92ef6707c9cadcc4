The upper house of parliament increased the 2019 budget by 80 billion Naira ($222 million), up from the 8.83 trillion Naira ($24.5 billion) presented by President Muhammadu Buhari to lawmakers last year. Buhari needs to sign the budget for it to become law. “There is a slight increase in the budget deficit. There was also the need to provide more funds for the security and intelligence agencies to deal with additional emerging/unforeseen security challenges in the country,” the Senate Chairman on appropriation, Senator Mohammed Goje said in a budget paper. On Saturday, gunmen kidnapped three oil workers from Canada, Scotland and Nigeria at a rig in Nigeria’s Delta region, the second abduction in the area in less than a week. Two weeks ago, kidnappers in Nigeria killed a British woman and a Nigerian man, and abducted three others in the northern city of Kaduna. The budget paper showed that funds were also voted as severance pay to outgoing lawmakers that lost re-election during the February national election and for the induction of new Senators. Parliament said the 2019 budget was aimed at consolidating growth. It approved a budget deficit of 1.9 trillion Naira ($5.2 billion), representing 1.37% of GDP. Nigeria’s economy grew by 1.93% last year, its fastest pace since a recession two years earlier, data showed, while inflation which has been in double digits for three years, fell to 11.25% in March. Buhari starts a second term of four years at the end of May. He won re-election pledging to revive the economy, improve security and tackle corruption. Parliament based its budget approval on estimated crude production of 2.3 million barrels a day, assumed oil price of $60 per barrel and an exchange rate of 305 Naira to the Dollar.
