Voters are being urged to check that both their ballot papers have been stamped at the back. 

The appeal has been made by Deputy Chief Electoral Officer, Mawethu Mosery. Mosery says the stamp on the backs of both ballot papers validates those ballots. "Because a ballot paper without the authentication stamp that I referred to earlier on, is an invalid ballot, we ask voters and party agents to be alert to the fact that ballots are stamped at the back."
