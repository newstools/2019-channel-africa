The department says this is due to reports of three anthrax outbreaks which are believed to have claimed the lives of 24 cattle in May alone. The Department's Zweli Silangwe says they are in contact with Lesotho. An alert about the outbreak of anthrax was issued in neighbouring Lesotho. The outbreak was in the region of Maseru, the capital city of the mountain kingdom. Lesothoâ€™s Health Ministry confirmed the outbreak. Farmers from Ha-Tseka were warned not to take their products to a Maseru trade fair. Even animal movement between Free State and Lesotho were restricted. --SABC--
