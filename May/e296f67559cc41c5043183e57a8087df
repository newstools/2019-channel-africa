The two sides have imposed tariffs on $360 billion in two-way trade since in 2018 but Trump and Chinese leader, Xi Jinping, agreed to a truce in December to refrain from further escalation. "The Trade Deal with China continues, but too slowly, as they attempt to renegotiate. No!" tweeted Trump. "For 10 months, China has been paying Tariffs to the USA of 25% on $50 billion of High Tech, and 10% on $200 billion of other goods," Turmp tweeted. "The 10% will go up to 25% on Friday," he said. -- AFP--
