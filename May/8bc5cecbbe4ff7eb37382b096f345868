Nestle has come under pressure from activist investor Daniel Loeb’s Third Point, which in 2018 demanded a faster turnaround. "Our wide portfolio makes us strong, not everything is going to change," Schneider said. "You have to find focus and areas where you concentrate your efforts," he said, identifying water, baby food and animal food as Nestle’s growth drivers. "Sweets are not among those. But we also want to exploit the opportunities of that market." Schneider said 2019 had got off to a good start, but efficiency remained important, saying unprofitable sales growth did not make sense. 

Nestle had to adjust because customer preferences had changed dramatically in recent years, he added, with ever-increasing price pressure from consumers. "There is very strong price competition. That is reality,”"Schneider said. --Reuters--
