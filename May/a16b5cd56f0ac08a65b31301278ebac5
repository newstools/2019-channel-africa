The opposition alliance, known as the Declaration of Freedom and Change Forces (DFCF), also vowed to continue sit-ins outside the defence ministry and across the country. Earlier in the day, the Transitional Military Council (TMC)suspended the talks after protesters broke a deal on de-escalation, the council head said in a televised statement. --REUTERS--
