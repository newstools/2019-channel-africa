Jean Anastase Hicuburundi said the independent media had tried to bring the country to its knees and had a mission to create chaos. He said it was responsible for the violence that engulfed Burundi after the presidential election in 2015, when President Pierre Nkurunziza decided to run for a third term in office. Burundi recently banned BBC and Voice of America journalists from working in the country. Burundi, one of the world's poorest nations, is struggling to emerge from a 12-year, ethnic-based civil war. Since independence in 1962 it has been plagued by tension between the usually-dominant Tutsi minority and the Hutu majority. A civil war, sparked off in 1994 made Burundi the scene of one of Africa's most intractable conflicts.  --BBC--
