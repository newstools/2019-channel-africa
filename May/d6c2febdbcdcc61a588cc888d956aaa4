Kolisi was forced from the field during the Stormers' win over the Highlanders last Saturday and although the exact extent of the injury is not yet known, it's expected to sideline him until mid-July. And that might have an impact on his availability for the Springboks as well. South Africa are set to play their first match in a shortened Rugby Championship against Australia at Ellis Park in Johannesburg on July 20 which gives Kolisi very little time to recover and get back up to match fitness. Kolisi is expected to be named Springbok captain for both the Rugby Championship and the Rugby World Cup in September. --News24--
