The nine-time African champions are drawn in a tough first round group that includes hosts France, Norway and South Korea. The 'Super Falcons' reached the quarter-finals in 1999, their best performance in seven previous appearances at the World Cup finals. "I hope we can get to the quarter-finals and from there anything can happen," the Swedish coach said Monday. "The whole team will do a big effort to reach the knockout stage and if we are there, the other teams will definitely have more pressure on them than us." The Falcons' confidence has been boosted by winning the sub-regional WAFU Nations Cup at the weekend in Abidjan after they crashed out of the competition in the semi-finals in 2018. Dennerby said the Falcons would bring the fighting spirit they displayed at the WAFU Cup to the world stage. "We fought a lot knowing that a game is not over till the final whistle from the referee and I hope we bring such spirit to the World Cup," he said. The team have opened their training camp in Austria prior to the World Cup, which kicks off on June 7.
