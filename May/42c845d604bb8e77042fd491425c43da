The move has been strongly criticised, given rising poverty levels across the country. It is unclear how much the pension will be, but if the state governor eventually approves it, Kano state would be the first in Nigeria to implement such a law. Nigeria has the largest number of people living in extreme poverty in the world and Kano is the country's most populous state. But the current speaker of the Kano state House of Assembly, Kabiru Alhassan Rurum, told the BBC the new law was to counteract corruption and prevent politicians from facing hardship when they are out of office. At the moment, former Nigerian presidents, state governors as well as the Senate president and the speaker of the Federal House of Representatives are entitled to pensions at the end of their tenure. Transparency International scores Nigeria as highly corrupt on its corruption perceptions index. --BBC--
