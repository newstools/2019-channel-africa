A downgrade by Moody’s Investors Service would leave South Africa without any investment-grade credit rating for the first time in 25 years. It would also see the country fall out of investment-grade debt gauges including the FTSE World Government Bond Index. This could trigger around $1.5 billion in forced outflows, the Reserve Bank said, citing International Monetary Fund estimates. "The high level of the South African government’s contingent liabilities and the high probability of significant amounts of these contingent liabilities materialising, as well as Eskom’s current large debt levels, pose a threat to South Africa’s sovereign credit rating," the central bank said in its six-monthly Financial Stability Review released Wednesday in the capital, Pretoria. The cash-strapped power utility accounts for more than half of the government’s $36.18 billion guarantees to state companies, the central bank said, citing data from the National Treasury. --News24--
