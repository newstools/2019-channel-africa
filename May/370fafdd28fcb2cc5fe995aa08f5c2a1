In Gauteng, which has seen numerous service delivery protests and threats of election boycotts in the run up to Wednesdayâ€™s polls, police have been put on high alert for any eventuality. There has been protests in Bekkersdal, Alexandra, Ennerdale and in parts of Tshwane. Gauteng police say deployments to the 2 760 voting districts in the province will be intelligence driven and responsive. They have appealed to the public to work with them during the elections to fight any criminal elements. About 3 000 Johannesburg Metro police officers have been deployed across Johannesburg for the elections. Gauteng police spokesperson Mathapelo Peters says: "Measures have been put in place in anticipation of possible security breaches that were prevalent in previous elections such as: intimidation of voters and electoral officers; obstruction of voting and the voting process; public violence and malicious damage to property; theft and common robberies at or near voting stations."
