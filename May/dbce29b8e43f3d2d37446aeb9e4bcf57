Lauda, who died on May 20 at the age of 70, was three-time world champion whose track victories and comeback from a horrific crash enthralled race fans worldwide. "We all loved and admired Niki. We admired his courage, his will, his strength, his love," said Austrian-born actor and former California governor, Arnold Schwarzenegger, during the packed funeral mass at St. Stephen's Cathedral. He suffered horrific injuries on August 1, 1976 when, having already won five races that season, his vehicle burst into flames on the Nuerburgring in Germany. He had severe burns to his face and hands, and inhaled toxic fumes which damaged his lungs. "Goodbye, world champion! Thank you for everything," Austrian President Alexander Van der Bellen told the mourners, who in addition to Lauda's family and hundreds of VIP guests, also included onlookers from all over Austria and further afield. The guests included other Formula One heavyweights, such as Mercedes chief Toto Wolff and Valtteri Bottas, as well as French former F1 driver Alain Prost, Austrian former F1 driver Gerhard Berger, and former Chancellor Sebastian Kurz, who was removed from office by a no-confidence vote this week. Songs that were reportedly Lauda's favourites, such as "Amazing Grace", "Fast Car" by Tracy Chapman and John Lennon's "Imagine" were played. Many in the crowds both inside and outside the cathedral wore red caps similar to the ones that became Lauda's trademark, which he used to cover the scars from his accident. A Ferrari flag could also be seen. Lauda won the drivers' world championship in 1975 and 1977 with Ferrari and in 1984 with McLaren. --News24--
