After a stuttering start to the clay-court season as he failed to reach the finals in Monte-Carlo, Barcelona and Madrid, Nadal found some form in Rome this week. He was back to usual best on the red dirt on Sunday as he brushed aside world No 1 Djokovic 6-0, 4-6, 6-1 to win his first title of the 2019 season. The Serb believes the 17-time Grand Slam winner will head to the French Open as the favourite, but he also feels Barcelona Open winner Dominic Thiem and Fabio Fognini, who won in Monte-Carlo cannot be written off. "Nadal the number one favourite, without a doubt, and then everyone else," he said. "But it is going to be a good tournament. Dominic Thiem is playing some really, really good tennis, he can beat anyone, especially on clay. "Fognini is also playing great quality tennis. He showed against Nadal in Monte-Carlo what he is capable of.
