Homa fired a four-under par 67 at Quail Hollow to finish 72 holes at 15-under 269 on the Charlotte, North Carolina, layout. The world number 417's best prior US PGA finish came when he took a share of sixth at the 2015 Sony Open in Hawaii. Homa twice lost his playing rights on the US PGA Tour, making just two cuts in 17 events in the 2016-17 campaign only to earn his way back again for this season and now secure his spot for years to come. "Over the moon," Homa said of his feelings. "I have some serious scar tissue from out here. Job security is great man. I haven't had that before." Joel Dahmen, another American seeking his first US PGA title, was second on 272 after a closing 70 with world number two, Rose of England third on 273 and Spain's Sergio Garcia, England's Paul Casey, American Rickie Fowler and his countryman Dufner all sharing fourth on 275. Prior first-time US PGA winners at Quail Hollow included Rory McIlroy in 2010, Fowler in 2012 and Anthony Kim in 2008. --News24--
