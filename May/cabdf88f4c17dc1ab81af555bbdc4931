SoftBank is considering taking the Saudi-backed investment fund public, a source said on Friday, adding that no formal process has been started. Shares of the group rose as much as 4% on Monday as trading resumed after Japan’s extended "Golden Week" holidays. Following the listing of the group’s domestic telco SoftBank Corp in December, the Vision Fund is the largest segment in SoftBank’s earnings without a market valuation. It is, however, unclear how the world’s largest technology investment fund could be listed in its current form. SoftBank is expected to post on Thursday a 1% rise in operating profit to $1.41 billion for the three months ended March, an average estimate of three analysts polled by Refinitiv shows. SoftBank has not provided a forecast and moved to new accounting standards this financial year. --Reuters--
