Then the China-US trade war started. Since Beijing began to impose retaliatory tariffs on US goods last year, Xu has halted imports, his profits have plummeted, and he may soon need to raise his prices just to survive which could kill off sales for good. Xu, who is 42 and owns Shanghai-based Company Sam Wood, doesn't mince words over who's to blame. "Trump is so bossy and irrational, it forces us to fight back," he said. "Even though (China's tariffs) do harm to our economy, we strongly support Uncle Xi and China's tough stance in the trade negotiations," he added, using the government-encouraged term of endearment for President Xi Jinping. The world's two largest economies have levied tit-for-tat tariffs on hundreds of billions of dollarsâ€™ worth of each other's imports since President Donald Trump launched the trade battle last year, seeking to pressure Beijing to change trade policies he calls unfair.

But the impact on small- to medium-sized Chinese businesses caught in the crossfire typically gets little attention, partly because China's Communist government suppresses bad news.
