The world number 15 took a one-shot lead after posting seven birdies and one bogey as he chases only his second PGA Tour victory. Finau, who managed a fifth place finish in the Masters last month but struggled in the PGA Championship, finishing tied in 64th, started slowly before making back-to-back birdies on the third and fourth holes. His opening birdie on the third came after he rolled in a 19-foot putt, and he backed it up on the par-three fourth by sticking his tee shot to within three feet for a simple tap-in. A bogey on the fifth threatened to check Finau's momentum, but he responded with back-to-back birdies on the 7 and 8 holes to reach the turn at three under. A hat-trick of birdies on the 11, 12 and 13 saw Finau vault up the leader board. Once again, the 29-year-old relied on a red-hot putter to pick up shots, draining putts of 24 feet and 26 feet to bag his final two birdies of the day. --News24--
