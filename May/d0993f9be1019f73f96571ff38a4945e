The allegations centre on a $2.5 billion deal to modernise South Africa's defence forces in the late 1990s in which Zuma is accused of accepting bribes from Thales. Both deny the charges. Lawyers acting on behalf of Zuma and Thales will argue before a panel of three judges in the South African city of Pietermaritzburg that the long delay in proceedings make it impossible for them to receive a fair trial. The hearings are expected to conclude by the end of this week. Last year Zuma's party, the African National Congress, forced him to resign as President.
