Addressing the Security Council on Tuesday, Ghassan Salame said many countries were supplying weapons to the UN-recognised Government of National Accord (GNA) in Tripoli and forces led by renegade general Khalifa Haftar. The commander, who is allied to a rival administration in Libya's east, launched an offensive to seize the capital on April 4, but his forces have been bogged down in the southern outskirts of Tripoli. "The violence on the outskirts of Tripoli is just the start of a long and bloody war on the southern shores of the Mediterranean, imperilling the security of Libya's immediate neighbours and the wider Mediterranean region," Salame said. Without immediate measures to stop the flow of arms, "Libya will descend into civil war which could potentially lead to a Hobbesian all-against-all state of chaos or partition of the country", he said. Salame's appeal came after the GNA posted photographs over the weekend of dozens of Turkish-made armoured vehicles that it said on its Facebook page were fresh deliveries for its fighters. Pro-Haftar websites also posted photos and video footage of Jordanian-built armoured cars they said were supplied to the Haftar's Libyan National Army.
