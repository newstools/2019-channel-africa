Red Bull Racing will be hosting an exclusive event on the streets of Cape Town on June 2 from 12:00 midday until 17:00. For many South African Formula One fans, this will be as close as they ever get to see a real F1 car driven in anger. Aston Martin Red Bull Racing will roll out its championship-winning RB7 which claimed 18 pole
positions and 12 race wins from 19 starts during the 2011 season. The RB7 is powered by a screaming 2,4-litre, naturally aspirated V8. -- SudhirMatai--
