The past nine years of Mandela day has enjoyed global solidarity and support as Madiba's birthday and a day of action to change the lives of millions of people for the better. The new strategy, titled "Mandela Day: The Next Chapter", will focus on harnessing research, analysis and dialogue to inform a global database of needs for global partnerships to focus on. For the next decade until 2029 the Nelson Mandela Foundation will focus on five pillars, which are: Education and Literacy, Food and Nutrition, Shelter, Sanitation and Active Citizenship.Â
