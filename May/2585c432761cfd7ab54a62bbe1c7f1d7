South Africa security cluster is on a high alert as large crowds are expected at Loftus Versveld stadium in Pretoria where the ceremony will take place. Members of public are urged to park their vehicles at the Tshwane Events Centre, west of the CBD where they will be taken to the venue in shuttle coaches. GCIS director, Tshegofatso Modubu says:"So you go there, you park your car there and then, you will be shuttled to go to Rietondale." "You will be processed at Rietondale and then your buses will come and they will drop you off at gate two. At gate two you will get a media official that will then take you up to where you need to be situated."
