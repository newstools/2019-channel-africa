Huawei told Reuters on Friday that FedEx diverted two packages sent from Japan and addressed to Huawei in China to the US, and attempted to divert two more packages sent from Vietnam to Huawei offices elsewhere in Asia, all without authorisation, providing images of FedEx tracking records. Reuters could not verify the authenticity of the records. Shown the images of the tracking records, FedEx declined to make any comment, saying company policy prevented it from disclosing customer information. Huawei said the four packages only contained documents and "no technology," which Reuters was unable to independently confirm. Huawei declined to elaborate on why it thought the packages were diverted. Reuters was given no evidence the incident was related to the US government’s move to place Huawei and its affiliates on a trade blacklist in mid-May, effectively banning US firms from doing business with them on security grounds. "The recent experiences where important commercial documents sent via FedEx were not delivered to their destination, and instead were either diverted to, or were requested to be diverted to, FedEx in the US, undermines our confidence," Joe Kelly, a spokesperson for Huawei, told Reuters. 

"We will now have to review our logistics and document delivery support requirements as a direct result of these incidents," the spokesperson said.
