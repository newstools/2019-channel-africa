Speaking to Belgium's Le Soir newspaper, Macron described the elections, taking place in all 28 European Union states from May 23-26, as the most important since the bloc's first parliamentary ballot in 1979. With Washington and Beijing locked in a trade war, Britain mired in Brexit, multilateralism under threat globally and the EU still emerging from ten years of financial crisis and split by a debate over migration, he said it was essential that those who were committed to Europe worked together. "On the basis of the election results, we have to build a coalition that delivers on policies," said Macron. "We don’t want to end up with bad backroom compromises." His Republique En Marche party, competing on the EU stage for the first time and running neck-and-neck with Marine LePen's far-right Rassemblement National, is expected to be the core of the centrist, liberal alliance, currently known as ALDE but which could change its name. Le Pen came first in France in the last EU vote in 2014, partly as a result of low turnout. The ballot is also often a protest vote, and nationalist parties have since seen a rise in support across Europe. "We need men and women who understand Europe well, who have a strong mandate and can be part of a progressive coalition that I’m hoping for, working together with the Social Democrats, with elements of the Christian Democrats and the Greens," Macron told the newspaper. Since no single party will secure the required 376 seats to hold a majority, coalition-building will be key.
