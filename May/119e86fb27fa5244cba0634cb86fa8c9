The arrival has been announced before but it has not happened. According to Etienne Tshisekedi's brother, Archbishop Gerard Mulumba, once the body arrives at the airport it will be taken to the Martyrs' stadium in the capital, Kinshasa, for mourning. Tshisekedi died in Belgium's capital, Brussels, at the age 84 in February 2017, but his body remained there because of political tensions with former DRC President Joseph Kabila. His son, Felix, was elected president in last Decemberâ€™s controversial poll. Tshisekedi was in opposition for decades but failed in his attempts to become president.  -BBC--
