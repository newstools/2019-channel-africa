The 28-year-old South African had appealed against regulations restricting testosterone levels in female runners that would require her to take medication to reduce her testosterone level if she is to continue competing at 800m. Here are some of the tweets from her fans: If the Olympics is boycotting Caster Semenya’s womanhood, I think we boycott the Olympics. I know this is IAAF’s doing, but the Olympics can help shift the conversation by shifting their relationship to IAAF. - @IBJIYONGI The fact that Male athletes with biological advantages are seen as the greatest athletes, but a female athlete with a biological advantage is being told to take medication to stop it. Medication that will affect her performance is absolutely disgusting #CasterSemenya - @TheOriginalMBK Why are Caster Semenya’s natural but unusually high testosterone levels considered any different from say, an unusually tall female athlete who has a massive height advantage over the average woman?? Was she not just born with ‘good genes’ for running - @DaisyPearce6 Semenya can appeal against the Court of Arbitration for Sport's ruling to the Swiss Tribunal Courts within the next 30 days. --BBC--
