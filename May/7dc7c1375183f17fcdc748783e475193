Hours after initial results showed a record low turnout in Sunday’s election, soldiers and large numbers of police deployed on Wednesday across the economic capital Cotonou. Supporters of former president Boni Yayi, who led calls for a boycott of the ballot, took to the streets. They erected makeshift barriers of burning tyres, and chanting slogans against President Patrice Talon. Protesters have torched businesses, hurled stones, and smashed the windows of government buildings. Police fired tear gas to break up crowds. They continued their protests overnight, and remained on the streets Thursday. “Nobody has slept,” said one demonstrator on Thursday morning, who gave his name as Justin B. “Around 10pm, they cut the light and fired live ammunition,” he claimed, pointing to two empty bullet casings and bloodstains on the floor. “Two people were seriously injured, a man and a woman.” In the Cadjehoun district of Cotonou, where Yayi Boni’s house is, a resident also reported to have heard shots fired. The small West African state was held up as a model for democracy, but the situation has raised warnings from civil society and rights groups inside and outside Benin. Tough new eligibility criteria effectively barred opposition parties from fielding any candidates in last Sunday’s parliamentary elections. On the day itself, more than three-quarters of the country’s 5 million registered voters stayed at home. Turnout has never dropped below 50% since the country’s transition to democracy in 1990. --Africa News--
