Ghosh had resigned as chief of the country's feared National Intelligence and Security Service soon after the army ousted longtime leader Omar al-Bashir last month following mass protests. Ghosh had overseen a brutal NISS-led crackdown against protesters taking part in the demonstrations which had rocked Sudan since December. The operation left dozens killed and hundreds wounded, while thousands of protesters, opposition activists and journalists were arrested. On Monday, a team of policemen and prosecutors went to arrest Ghosh and search his house over alleged corruption, prosecutors said in a statement. "The force that was guarding the house of the accused, which is affiliated with NISS, stopped the order from being executed," they said. "It justified this by saying that it had not received any prior order or instruction" to allow Ghosh's arrest, they added. The statement added that prosecutors had seen security agents threatening police officers with guns.
