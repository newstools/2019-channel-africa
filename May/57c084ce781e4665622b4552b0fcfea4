Garin, 22, won a tight encounter 6-1, 3-6, 7-6 (7/1) to claim his second ATP Tour title, less than a month after he claimed his first one in Houston. It was Berrettini's second match of the day, having earlier defeated fourth-seeded Spaniard Roberto Bautista Agut 6-4, 6-2 in a rain-postponed semi-final. Garin was ranked 92nd just over two months ago but is projected to rise to a career-high 33 on Monday.
