This time, she may not have that option. Trump on Sunday vowed to lift tariffs on $200 billion of Chinese imports to 25% from 10% by the end of this week if no trade pact is sealed between the world’s two largest economies. Williams sources about 85% of the products for her business, Luggage Shop of Lubbock, from China, and she bought heavily before Trump’s first round of 10% hit last fall. "This time we will not have that opportunity. We won’t be able to load up," said Williams, who voted for Trump. Her sales are down since November, under pressure from tariff-related sticker-shock on her mainstay high-end products and competition from online rivals like Amazon.com Inc. In an e-mail on Monday she shared with Reuters, Samsonite told her it would again raise prices to match the tariffs if Trump makes good on his threat. --Reuters--
