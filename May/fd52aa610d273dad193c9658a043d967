The UN appealed for a humanitarian truce to coincide with the start of the Muslim holy month of Ramadan on Monday. But Gen Haftar called on his supporters to increase the determination and strength of their assault. Since he launched the attack on southern Tripoli a month ago, tens of thousands of civilians have fled their homes. On Saturday, Islamic State group militants said they were behind an attack on a training camp for the forces of Gen Haftar. Hospital officials said nine people were killed in the attack in Libya's southern city of Sabha.  --BBC--
