More than 10 000 cholera cases have been reported in the country since January this year and more than 240 deaths recorded, the World Health Organisation says. The first people in the drive were vaccinated on Monday. The Health Ministry will administer the first two doses of the oral cholera vaccine to people living in Binza, Goma, Kayina, Karisimbi, Kibirizi, Kirotshe and Rutshuru where a lot cases have been reported. The roll-out of the vaccination campaign will help in containing the unprecedented levels of epidemics that have been witnessed in DRC in the past few months, says the head of the Vaccine Alliance, Gavi. DRCâ€™s health ministry says measles and cholera epidemics are claiming the lives of thousands of people throughout the country. A second dose will be given at a later stage to provide full protection against the disease. Cholera is a disease that can cause severe diarrhoea. It takes between 12 hours and 5 days for a person to show symptoms after consuming contaminated food or water, and can kill within hours if untreated. The disease is common in places with poor sanitation, conflict zones and famine. --BBC--
