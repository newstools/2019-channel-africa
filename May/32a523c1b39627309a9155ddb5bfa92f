Townsend initially named a 42-man squad with space set aside for two players to force their way into contention. Both Glasgow Warriors players finished the 2018/19 season in impressive form, which they continued into Saturday’s PRO14 final that ended in narrow defeat to Leinster at Celtic Park. Townsend said: “We are fortunate to have a number of very good second-rowers available to us right now. “With Richie Gray, Tim Swinson and Andrew Davidson also in contention for this remaining place in our World Cup squad, Scott’s selection is a testament to how well he has performed throughout the season and in particular over the past few weeks. “He was impressive in his ball carrying, defence and his all-round work-rate on Saturday against Leinster and we look forward to working with him and the other four second-rows in our squad.” He added: “Kyle has made an excellent impact since his debut for Glasgow earlier this season and has displayed strong defensive capabilities as well as a providing go-forward for his team when carrying ball. With every game he has looked more assured and, from our point of view, he will primarily be considered a winger who can cover the centre position. “We have others in our squad that we view more as centre/wings but I’m sure over the course of the summer Kyle will get the opportunity to show what he can do in both positions.” The inclusion of Cummings and Steyn takes the Glasgow Warriors contribution to the extended squad to 19, all of whom will now be given time off to rest before checking into camp next month. Steyn, who qualifies for Scotland through his Scottish-born mother, previously captained Griquas in the Currie Cup, and played for Maties in the Varsity Cup.
