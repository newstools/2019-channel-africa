Baxter on Tuesday named his squad for this year's showpiece in Egypt, and during his press conference he opened up on some disturbing news he had received ahead of South Africa's trip to Libya in their final qualifying match back in March. "Before we went to Libya (the game was actually played in Tunisia) the doctor told me that he thought I had got cancer," Baxter told media. "I went to Tunisia and said 'no, I don't want to get tested. I've got a game to play and I don't want that in my mind. "It was bloody difficult trying to coach a team when you think you could have cancer. I got back and they did the tests and it was okay, thank goodness." Bafana, meanwhile, open their AFCON campaign when they take on Ivory Coast in Cairo on June 25.
