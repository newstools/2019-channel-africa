Among those freed in the presidential decree include Hassane Ahmed el-Barwane, Secretary General of the main Juwa opposition party. He was serving 7 years in prison for assaulting a soldier. Those whose life sentences were reduced to 20 years include, writer Said Ahmed Said Tourqui and Bahassane Ahmed Said, brother of former vice president Djaffar Ahmed Said, who sought refuge in France. Fahardine Mohamed is lawyer for the journalists freed. “We will give opinions later, now we are just happy and we share it with you journalists. It is a joy to you especially and we’ll tell you all we have to say in the coming days. For today, we have no comments,” he said. All those pardoned were jailed for up to 20 years on charges linked to unrest following a controversial constitutional referendum to extend the president’s term last year. Azali took the oath of office on Sunday, two months after his controversial re-election. He pledged “appeasement measures” to quell accusations of election fraud.  --Africa News--
