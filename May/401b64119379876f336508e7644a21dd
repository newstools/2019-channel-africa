South Africa, chasing 312 for victory in their 2019 World Cup opener, were 14/0 in the fourth over when Amla received a nasty blow to the grille of his helmet trying to pull a short ball from Archer, who was clocking speeds above 150km/h. A dazed Amla stumbled around the crease for a while before he retired hurt on 5.Â News from the Proteas camp is that he has undergone a concussion test and he is "fine". He returned to bat in the 32nd over. "He has been assessed and is doing fine," a Proteas spokesperson said. "Upon discussions with the tournament Chief Medical Officer, both agreed that if was fine for Hashim to return to play as per the ICC concussion guidelines."  --News24--
