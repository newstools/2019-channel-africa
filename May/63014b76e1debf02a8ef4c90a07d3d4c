A life-size bronze statue of the US-based academic will be unveiled alongside those of other honourees at Rockefeller Centre in New York City on August 26. The monument is intended to recognise Trent for her role in promoting equality and empowerment for girls and women. It will stand alongside new statues of other prominent women such as media mogul Oprah Winfrey, actress Nicole Kidman, conservationist Jane Goodall, actress Cate Blanchett, activist Janet Mock, chemist Tracy Dyson, author Cheryl Strayed and Olympic gymnast Gabby Douglas.  --BBC--
