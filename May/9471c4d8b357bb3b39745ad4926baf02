Guaidó on Tuesday made his strongest call yet to the military to help him oust Maduro. A power struggle between Maduro and Guaidó has been brewing since January, after Guaidó declared himself as interim leader. During a televised appearance, Maduro congratulated the armed forces for having defeated the group. 

The President added to say those responsible for yesterday's events will be punished and that he would come out victorious in the face of what he called a United States-backed coup. Meanwhile, Guaidó has since appealed for his supporters to take to the streets of Venezuela again, after yesterday's violent clashes. Maduro remains in the presidential palace and many see what happened as yet another failed attempt by the opposition to take power. --BBC--
