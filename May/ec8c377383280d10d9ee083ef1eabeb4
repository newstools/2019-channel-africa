The encounter serves as an opportunity for South Africa to level the series following their four-wicket loss in the third T20 in Pietermaritzburg at the weekend, which saw the touring side take a 2-1 lead. The fifth and final T20 will take place at the same venue on Thursday, May 23. Having come back from losing the opening match, Nackerdien says the team needs to channel their belief in order to do the same in Wednesday's clash. "We just have to back ourselves," the coach commented, during the pre-match preparations. "That belief system for me is very important. If you don't have that belief system and we can't manage a loss, then we are going to be in trouble. We need to make sure we do that 360-degree turnaround again, to get us back into the series and try to win the series. The main purpose for tomorrow is to win the game and do it properly." In the third T20 match, South Africa posted their highest total of the series thus far, recording 138/3 thanks to a stunning contribution of 70 not out off 61 balls from opener, Tazmin Brits, and a tidy knock of 36 off 35 balls from Nadine de Klerk. This followed impressive half-centuries from Marizanne Kapp (56) and Lizelle Lee (56) in the second T20, which the Proteas won comfortably by eight wickets. Nackerdien was pleased with what he saw in Pietermaritzburg but has highlighted a few other areas that can be improved on.
