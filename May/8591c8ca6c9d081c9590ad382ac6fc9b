At 0640 GMT the Rand was 0.1% weaker at 14.3550 per Dollar from an overnight close of 14.3400. The Rand has see-sawed in a narrow range, with little momentum in either direction, as investors wait for a US Fed policy meeting on Wednesday which is expected to keep lending rates unchanged. Locally, a Reuters poll of analysts forecast that March trade data, due at 1200 GMT, would show a R4.8 billion ($336 million) surplus. The Treasury is also due to publish monthly budget figures. Traders expect liquidity to be tight with local markets closed for the Workerâ€™s Day holiday before picking up in the run-up to national elections on May 8. Bonds also weakened, with the yield on the benchmark 10-year paper up 1 basis point to 8.545%. --Reuters--
