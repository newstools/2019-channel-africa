Occidental said in a statement on Sunday that the assets that would be sold are in Algeria, Ghana, Mozambique and South Africa. They would represent about 6% of Occidental’s proforma expected net production and 7% of the cash flow after capital expenditures for 2020. Occidental is locked in a bidding war with American multinational energy corporation, Chevron, to win control of Anadarko and become the leading producer in the fast-growing Permian Basin of West Texas and New Mexico. Anadarko agreed to resume talks with Occidental over its $76-a-share bid two weeks after announcing a $65-a-share deal with Chevron. President and Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of Occidental, Vicki Hollub, said in a statement “The $8.8 billion value to be received for Africa represents an attractive value based on our extensive evaluation over the last 18 months”. She further stated, “Total has extensive experience working in Africa and is well positioned to maximize value from these assets.’’ The French energy giant is a major player in the Liquefied Natural Gas market, and has a network of gasoline service stations in Mozambique. According to the statement, should the deal be finalized, it would largely wrap up the $10 billion asset divestiture plan Occidental, has targeted to complete the acquisition of Anadarko. Occidental’s Hollub, has been pursuing Anadarko for 15 months and recently recruited help from CEO of Berkshire Hathaway, Warren Buffett, to strengthen the bid. Buffett invested $10 billion in Occidental last week after Hollub flew to visit him in Omaha, Nebraska. --Fin24--
