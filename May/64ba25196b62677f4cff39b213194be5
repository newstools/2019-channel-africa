ZIFA has received a conditional suspension from COSAFA, but can fix the situation within two months if they confirm the country as hosts of the 2020 COSAFA Cup, and provide the already signed guarantees from the Zimbabwe government to this effect. Failure to do so the association will be suspended, though the two-month grace period will allow the national team to compete in the 2019 COSAFA Cup in Durban, South Africa, from May 25 â€“ June 8. ZIFA have also been fined $50 000, with a further amount of $150 000, suspended until the above condition over 2020 hosting has been met. The COSAFA Disciplinary Body was chaired by Antonio Caetano de Sousa, accompanied by Adrian Kashala and Daud Suleman. This means it is now all systems go for the draw for the 2019 COSAFA Cup, which will be held on the on May 2. Madagascar is the only one of the 14 COSAFA countries who have declined an invitation for 2019, but will be replaced by Africa Cup of Nations-bound Uganda in what is an exciting development for the country. The format for the competition will be the same as in previous years, with the eight lowest-ranked sides to be drawn into two pools each containing four sides. --Cosafa--
