The Germany international has not been a regular starter for the Bundesliga champions for some time now, having failed to start 20 or more games for the past four seasons. The 30-year-old has been with the club since 2011 and has had an extremely successful spell with the Bavarian side, winning his seventh straight title earlier this month while also picking up the Champions League in 2013. However, he has now been told by club president Uli Hoeness that he can leave the club, and he will be even more surplus to requirements should they successfully pursue Ajax defender Matthijs de Ligt, whom they have been strongly linked with. "I would recommend him as a friend to leave the club," Hoeness told BR. "He needs a new challenge, recently he has seemed out of place." Despite having two years remaining on his current deal, a cut-price fee is likely for the former Manchester City defender, meaning Arsenal could be set to pounce in the summer.
