The local currency opened the day at R14.73/$ and fell by 1% in early trade before making up its earlier losses into the afternoon. By 20:50, minutes before Ramaphosa started to speak, it was at its opening price. At 22:22 it was changing hands at R14.66/$, up 0.5%. In a note to clients, however, Bianca Botes, Corporate Treasury Manager at Peregrine Treasury Solutions, said the retention of Tito Mboweni and Pravin Gordhan will likely appease markets and result in a positive perception of Cabinet. "These key appointments should contribute to political stability while ensuring the continuance of the pro-economic growth foundation set by the President and the two ministers, in particular, over the past year." However, Botes added, gains could be limited, as the national executive had "disappointed" by assigning David Mabuza the role of deputy president, "indicating that President Ramaphosa had to compromise to appease the Jacob Zuma faction within the ANC". "The rand showed little reaction to the announcement of Cabinet, with the Deputy Presidency of Mabuza having largely been priced in after his swearing in as an MP on Tuesday," Botes said. Analysts have warned that while the rand may strengthen in the wake of the Cabinet announcement, uncertainty around US-China trade talks and Brexit will likely still dampen demand for emerging market currencies. --News24--
