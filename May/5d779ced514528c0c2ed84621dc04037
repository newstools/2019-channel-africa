Currently there’s steady progress in the counting of votes and results are slowly trickling in. In the last hour, about 5% of voting districts had completed counting votes. The African National Congress (ANC) was in the lead with 50% of the votes followed by the Democratic Alliance (DA) with 26% and in third position was the Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) with 13% of the votes. These are initial statistics and no predictions can be made at this stage. Deputy Manager for Electoral Matters at IEC, Ledimo Nthejane, says their teams are working hard. “The picture has changed substantially from the point when the voting stations closed. During the cause of today, there will be a spike as presiding officers will be finalising their counting. There will be significant progress on the results that will be processed as the day progresses towards the afternoon and evening,” says Nthejane. --SABC-- IEC is really a joke.
