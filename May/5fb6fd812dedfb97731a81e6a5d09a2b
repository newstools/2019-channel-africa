Trump is on a four-day state visit to Japan meant to showcase the alliance between the two nations, but which has also been shadowed by trade tensions. Trump explicitly linked trade and security, a connection that disturbs Tokyo, whose alliance with Washington stands at the core of its defense policies. "It’s all a balance sheet thing," he said. "When I talk about a security threat, I talk about a balance sheet. "In order to have $716 billion dollars a year in military expenditures, you have to have a lot of money coming in," he said, adding that Japan had bought "tremendous amounts" of US military gear. On Sunday, Trump tweeted that he expected big moves on trade would wait until after Japan’s upper house election in July.
