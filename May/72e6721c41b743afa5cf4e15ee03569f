Federer heads into his 15 Roland Garros third-round match looking in strong form after back-to-back straight-sets wins over Italian Lorenzo Sonego and German lucky loser Oscar Otte, and faces another unknown quantity in Casper Ruud. The Norwegian's father Christian actually played in the 1999 French Open when a 17-year-old Federer made his main-draw debut. "They practised together," said Casper ahead of his big day on Court Suzanne Lenglen. "So I think I remember I thought it was cool, but I was young when he told me. I didn't realise how big of a player and champion Roger was at the time." Federer has gone on to win a record 20 Grand Slam titles since, although his sole French Open success came ten years ago. Nadal leads head-to-head 3-1 Nadal faces a tricky contest against former top-ten player Goffin on Court Philippe Chatrier after strolling through his first two rounds against German qualifiers Yannick Hanfmann and Yannick Maden. The 11-time champion is a red-hot favourite to win a record-extending 12th title, and has beaten Goffin in three of their four meetings, including all three on clay. But Goffin will take heart from their quarter-final meeting in Madrid two years ago, when he managed to force a tie-break in the opening set. "He (Goffin) is a very complex player. He has all the shots," said Nadal. "He's a player who has had an amazing career, and we practised a lot of times. We know each other well." --News24--
