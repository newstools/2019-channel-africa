In the non-binding vote in the General Assembly in New York, 116 states were in favour and only six against, a major diplomatic blow to the UK. Fifty-six states, including France and Germany, abstained. Mauritius says it was forced to give up the Indian Ocean group, now a British overseas territory, in 1965 in exchange for independence. In a statement to the BBC, the UK's Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) said Britain did not recognise Mauritius' claim to sovereignty, but would stand by an earlier commitment to hand over control of the islands to Mauritius when they were no longer needed for defence purposes. The US, Hungary, Israel, Australia and the Maldives were the states voting with the UK against the resolution. It comes months after the UN's high court advised that the UK should leave the islands "as rapidly as possible". --BBC--
