This as South Africa wrapped up its first day of special voting. The special voting will continue on Tuesday. Speaking to the SABC News at the Independent Electoral Commission’s Results Operation Centre, on Monday, Jonathan said the body that manages the elections plays an important role in ensuring safe and successful elections. “This year’s election appears to be one of the strongest contested elections so far in the history of SA democracy and everybody is interested in the outcome. We have observed some of the rallies and we are quite comfortable how things are going. He adds, “The key thing about elections is the body managing the election and of course the security, the police. If the stakeholders, the political parties have confidence in these two organisations, then of course we are quite hopeful.”
