Reinach was the only Northampton Saints player to have made the Dream Team, while Mostert is one of four Gloucester representatives, alongside Danny Cipriani, Mark Atkinson and Ollie Thorley. Meanwhile, Reinach, along with fellow South African scrumhalf Faf de Klerk, joined Cipriani, Alex Goode, Matt Kvesic and Steven Luatua on a six-man shortlist for the Player of the Year award. Cipriani scooped that prize at the awards ceremony in London on Wednesday. Reinach was also the joint top try-scorer of the season alongside Sale Sharks wing Denny Solomona. Mostert is expected to be named in the Springboks' 31-man Rugby World Cup squad later this year, while Reinach's stock has grown in recent months and he too could well find himself aboard the flight bound for Japan. English Premiership Dream Team: 15 Alex Goode (Saracens), 14 Santiago Cordero (Exeter Chiefs), 13 Henry Slade (Exeter Chiefs), 12 Mark Atkinson (Gloucester), 11 Ollie Thorley (Gloucester), 10 Danny Cipriani (Gloucester), 9 Cobus Reinach (Northampton Saints), 8 Matt Kvesic (Exeter Chiefs), 7 Tom Curry (Sale Sharks), 6 Alex Dombrandt (Harlequins), 5 Will Skelton (Saracens), 4 Franco Mostert (Gloucester), 3 John Afoa (Bristol Bears), 2 Jamie George (Saracens), 1 Mako Vunip0la (Saracens).
