This week has seen the Barbados-born paceman give a glimpse of his ability while making his one-day international and Twenty20 debuts for England after completing a three-year residency qualification period. In particular, his ability to bowl 90mph yorkers as well as deceptive off-cutters has caught the eye of Root, England's Test captain. Archer, who has impressed previously in Twenty20 franchise competitions such as the Indian Premier League, will continue with his late bid to gain a place in tournament hosts England's squad for the 50-over World Cup when a five-match ODI series against Pakistan starts in London at The Oval on Wednesday. But Root reckons Archer's game could be suited to the Test arena as well, even though the 24-year-old has played in a mere 28-first-class matches since making his Sussex debut in 2016.Â "I'm looking at everyone with an eye towards the Ashes," Root said when asked about Archer's chances of playing Test cricket. "Anyone that's in the shake up for it, naturally you will."
