“We are excited because appreciation of Zambian emeralds is gaining momentum internationally given the uniqueness, clarity and transparency that is characteristic of the gemstones,” Gemfields’ gemmologist Elena Basaglia said in a statement. To date, Kagem has contributed approximately US$107 million to the Zambian government in cumulative corporation taxes, mineral royalties and dividends. This means almost 20 % of Kagem’s revenue has flowed to Lusaka in the last decade. Kagem, which is 75 % owned by Gemfields while the Industrial Development Corporation of Zambia has a 25 % stake, is the world’s largest emerald mine and source of ‘Inkalamu’, the ‘Lion Emerald’, a 5,655 carat emerald crystal and one of the most unique stones to have come from the mine. Jewellery featuring Zambian emeralds includes Fabergé’s  Lady Libertine II timepiece presenting a dial set with a central cabochon Kagem emerald, surrounded by hand-carved Kagem emeralds. --IOL--
