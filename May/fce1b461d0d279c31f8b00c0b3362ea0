Although "we're seeing the first signs of your strategy," a share price touching lows of $7.07 on Thursday "reflects investors' huge concerns" about the future of Germany's largest lender, small shareholders' representative Klaus Nieding told chief executive Christian Sewing. It was "indispensable" for bosses to change the tune at the investment banking arm, Nieding added, although he praised executives for recent merger talks with rival Commerzbank that ultimately fell through. Alexandra Annecke of Union Investment was less temperate, judging that "shareholders have reached the end of their patience" ,adding for good measure that "directors' salaries bear no relation to performance or the share price". Several shareholder representatives have already said they would vote against the bank's leadership later Thursday, criticising especially supervisory board chief Paul Achleitner, seen as having failed over the past seven years to bring the institution back on course. --AFP--
