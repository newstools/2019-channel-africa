The council also said that former intelligence chief Salah Gosh was under house arrest and that more than four members of the council had resigned.

Meanwhile the African Union and the United Nations say they are supporting a civilian-led transitional government in Sudan following last month's overthrow of President Omar al-Bashir. 

AU Commission Chairperson Moussa Faki Mahamat told reporters after meeting Monday with UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres. 

He says there is no question of sustaining the military council that assumed power after al-Bashir's ouster, saying it is not acceptable. But he said military members could be part of a civilian government.
