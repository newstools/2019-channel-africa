The Pixel 3a phone, which includes many of the artificial intelligence features of its flagship devices, is priced from $399, executives said as Google opened its annual I/O developers’ conference near its headquarters in the Silicon Valley city of Mountain View. "There has been a troubling trend of high-end phones getting more expensive," Google head of hardware Rick Osterloh said. "So, we challenged ourselves to deliver a high-end experience in a new Pixel 3a starting at $399." The new Pixel was available at Google’s online shop. Osterloh contended that the price is about half that of latest generation premium smartphones but is built with camera, digital assistant and other features found in top-end handsets. "They just redefined what a mid-priced phone can do," Forrester Research principal analyst Frank Gillett said at the event. "But they didn’t tell us what compromises they made on the hardware." Google’s expertise is software, so getting features like artificial intelligence to work on less costly smartphones plays to the internet giant’s strength, according to Gillett. --AFP--
