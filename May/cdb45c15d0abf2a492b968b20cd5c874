Waititu has a reputation of being bullish, and even thuggish, but he is a powerful ally of President Uhuru Kenyatta, who hails from Kiambu county and is therefore reliant to some extent on the governor for his political support. Local media has been awash with reports in recent weeks about Waititu's wealth, including properties he owns in Kiambu and in the capital, Nairobi. Waititu fended off the criticism, saying he had never acquired his wealth illegally and could account for it. Recently, pressure has been mounting on President Kenyatta to walk the talk in his campaign against endemic corruption among state officials. Now, the EACC has swooped on one of his allies, but whether it leads to a prosecution is to be seen. --BBC--
