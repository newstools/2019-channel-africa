The sixth-seeded pair of Klaasen and his New Zealand partner, Michael Venus, were on Tuesday eliminated when they lost to Marius Copil (Belgium) and Rohan Bopanna (India) in straight sets 6-3, 7-6 (7/4). Copil and Bopanna are unseeded in the tournament. Klaasen, whose best finish in the clay-court Grand Slam was in the third round last year, now leaves Lloyd Harris in the singles as the only South African remaining in the tournament.
