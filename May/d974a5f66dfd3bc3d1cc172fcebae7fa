On April 15, the AU gave the council 15 days to cede power, however, the TMC ignored the deadline. The AU Peace and Security Council have reiterated in a statement its “conviction that a military-led transition in the Sudan will be totally unacceptable and contrary to the will and legitimate aspirations, to democratic institutions and processes, as well as respect for human rights and freedoms of the Sudanese people.” The Military Council said the AU envoy to Sudan, Mohamed Al-Hassan Ould Labbat, arrived in Khartoum on Tuesday, where he met with TMC spokesperson, Shams El Din Kabbashi. The meeting dealt with steps taken since the visit of the AU Commission Chairperson, Moussa Faki, to Sudan as well as dialogue with the Sudanese opposition. Ould Labbat said that his mission is to “help Sudan find solutions made by the Sudanese themselves”. A day earlier, the Sudanese opposition accused the TMC of not being serious about handing over power to civilians after the overthrow of Former President Omar al-Bashir.  --Middle East Monitor--
