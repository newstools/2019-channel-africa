The Central African country has been under pressure to restructure its external debt from the International Monetary Fund (IMF), which says long-delayed financial support will only be unlocked once Congo’s debt burden is made sustainable. The government did not provide details of the terms of the restructuring, which it said had been agreed with the Export-Import Bank of China (EximBank) during a recent visit by a delegation from Brazzaville to China. “This agreement, which is crucial for our country, is the result of two years of negotiations and promises interesting prospects for further negotiations with our technical financial partners particularly the IMF and the World Bank,” it said in a statement. It was not immediately possible to reach representatives of China’s EximBank for comment. Congo Republic’s debt to China amounted to nearly 1.4 trillion CFA Francs ($2.4 billion) as of October 2017, according to comments by Prime Minister, Clement Mouamba at the time. In March, the central bank said Congo’s external debt had fallen to 85% of GDP from 110% last July, when it stood at around $9.14 billion. Like other Central African oil-producing countries, Congo was hit by low crude prices. While several neighbours, including Chad and Gabon, secured bailouts from the IMF, talks with Congo have dragged on since 2017. The Congolese economy grew 1.9% in 2018, rebounding from a 2% contraction the previous year. It expects growth of 1.2% for 2019. --Reuters--
