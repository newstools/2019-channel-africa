Mewis got the opener after 37 minutes with a shot under the keeper from 20 metres after some nice footwork outside the box. She struck again from close range 12 minutes from time before Lloyd’s 108th international goal in added time put a more respectable sheen on the scoreline for the hosts who dominated the first of three friendlies ahead of next month’s World Cup. The US, World Cup winners in 1991, 1999 and 2015, play New Zealand on May 16 and Mexico 10 days later before heading to France to face Group F opponents Thailand, Chile and Sweden. South Africa, who had Noko Matlou taken off on a stretcher in the 51st minute, are playing at the World Cup for the first time. They will face Norway in a June 2 friendly before lining up against Group B rivals Spain, Germany and China. The tournament kicks off on June 7 when hosts France play South Korea. --Reuters--
