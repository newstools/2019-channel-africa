Brazzaville says due to this, Eni would no longer be qualified to recover its “investment costs”. But it’s not all bad news for Eni Congo. The Italian multinational oil and gas company which has been operational in this Central African nation since 1968 would have other oil exploration projects continue in Congo. We speak to Chairman of the Energy Strategies and Policies based in Paris, France. Francis Perrin joins us from Geneva, Switzerland to help us understand the consequences of this decision on the oil and gas market in Congo. President Cyril Ramaphosa has said the government won’t cut jobs at state power utility, Eskom, as it divides the company into three separate businesses. Ramaphosa announced the plan to divide the company into generation, transmission and distribution units in February, and there was an immediate backlash from labor unions who are concerned that the plan could lead to job losses. Eskom has 47 000 workers, a figure the World Bank has said is 66% too high, and debt in excess of $29.7 billion. “What we will need to do going forward is to strengthen Eskom,” Ramaphosa said in an interview with Newzroom Afrika, a Johannesburg-based television station that started broadcasting today. “As the restructuring job unfolds, no we don’t see the loss of jobs.” Eskom has been described by Goldman Sachs Group as the biggest threat to the South African economy and isn’t generating sufficient cash to meet its maintenance costs, resulting in frequent power cuts so far this year. It has been embroiled in corruption scandals. The company won’t cut power to consumers this winter, Ramaphosa said, which runs from June until the end of August. --News24--
