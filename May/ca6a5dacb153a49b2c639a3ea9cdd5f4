Approved by lawmakers last month, the budget is based on estimated oil production of 2.3 million barrels a day, an assumed crude price of $60 per barrel. Nigeria’s economy, the largest in Africa, grew by 1.93% last year, its fastest pace since a recession two years earlier which was caused by the impact of low oil prices. The continent’s top oil producer relies on crude sales for about 90 % of its foreign exchange. The planned deficit of $29 billion represents 1.37% of GDP. Buhari is due to be inaugurated for a second four-year term on Wednesday. He won re-election in February after pledging to revive the economy, improve security and tackle corruption. Last month the upper house of parliament increased the budget by $224 presented by Buhari to lawmakers last year.  --Africa News--
