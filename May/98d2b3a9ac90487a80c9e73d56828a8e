On Tuesday, Trump tweeted “Hopefully, all Cuban soldiers will promptly and peacefully return to their island!”, further saying that foreign soldiers had caused “death and destruction to the Constitution of Venezuela.” Trump’s comments came after his National Security Adviser, John Bolton, said “Cuban thugs” were threatening members of the Venezuelan military that might be in support of acting President of Venezuela, Juan Guaido. Bolton also announced a number of steps designed to intensify pressure on Venezuela President, Nicolas Maduro’s government on Tuesday. Bolton publicly admonished Venezuelan officials,  including Defense Minister of Venezuela, Vladimir Padrino, Supreme Court Chief Justice, Maikel Moreno, and presidential guard commander, Ivan Hernandez Dala, who he said had privately backed a transition of power. The White House offered to remove economic sanctions from regime officials who allowed Guiado to seek power. White House Acting Chief of Staff, Mick Mulvaney, reiterated the administration’s vaguely threatening line that “all options are on the table” when it comes to military action. --Engineering news--
