Asked about the regulatory problems facing Huawei, he told investors: "Perhaps there is long term opportunity but more than that, it’s hard to say at this point." Analysts expect Nokia and its Swedish peer Ericsson to benefit from tensions between the United States and Huawei, the largest supplier of mobile network technology. Nokia last month reported a surprise quarterly loss after it failed to supply 5G telecoms equipment in time. Suri acknowledged the company had been a little slow in getting 5G technology up and running, citing merging its own technology plans with those of acquired Alcatel-Lucent as a reason. "We are late in 5G by a few weeks to a couple of months," Suri told the Finnish company’s annual shareholder meeting. Nokia said it has won one additional commercial 5G contract since it reported first quarter earnings in late April. --Reuters--
