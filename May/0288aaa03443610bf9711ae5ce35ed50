The new line, discussed exclusively with Reuters, will focus on smaller provincial cities, often in China’s western provinces, where greater shipping distances and lower incomes can make some imported brand goods unaffordable, though wealth there is growing. Producers of many consumer staples such as soft drinks and soap had to seek growth in the less-profitable provincial cities years ago, as China’s richer eastern markets matured. But the baby milk units of Nestle, France’s Danone and Reckitt Benckiser enjoyed years of prosperity mainly just targeting parents in big cities like Shanghai and Beijing, banking on their appetite for ever-pricier premium formulas and foreign brands following a domestic 2008 tainted milk scandal. Slowing growth has now made geographic expansion crucial, and new distribution models have made it easier. The big catch, however, is the intense competition and logistical hurdles they will encounter in China’s $25 billion baby formula market as they run up against local players who dominate in the smaller cities - challenges that mirror those faced by Western brands across China’s consumer goods sector. --Reuters--
