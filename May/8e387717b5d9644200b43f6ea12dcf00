South Africa middle-distance star Semenya lost a challenge against the International Association of Athletic Federations (IAAF) over plans to force some women to regulate their testosterone levels. The Court of Arbitration for Sport’s decision means that female athletes with elevated testosterone will have to take drugs that suppress those levels if they wish to compete as women in certain events. The IAAF argued that athletes such as two-time Olympic 800 metres champion Semenya had an unfair advantage over others. McColgan, whose daughter Eilish has run against Semenya, expressed sympathy but backed the 2-1 CAS verdict as a necessary ruling to protect the integrity of women’s sport. But the Scot also suggested Sunday that one forward would be to create new categories for some non-binary genders. She also echoed concerns over Semenya being required to take drugs in order to continue running from the World Medical Association (WMA), which urged doctors not to enforce the new IAAF rules. "I personally think (CAS made) the right decision but I think there are still grey areas that have to be ironed out," McColgan told BBC Radio. "I do not agree that anyone should take any drugs to reduce testosterone because I’m a big supporter of a drug-free sport and I’d be a bit of a hypocrite if I said (Semenya) should take medication to suppress what is naturally high in her." McColgan added: "A lot of people are making this out to be a Caster Semenya story and it’s not really about Caster. "There’s a bigger area we’re talking about and it’s about future athletes and how we can protect women’s sport. "There are two categories, there’s men and there’s women, and it’s how do we protect women in sport and the future for that? -- AFP--
