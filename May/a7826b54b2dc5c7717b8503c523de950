The two sides have disagreed over the composition of a transitional council but the coalition of activists and opposition political groups, known as the Declaration of Freedom and Change, says it hopes to reach an agreement with the military generals within 72 hours. Protesters are still holding a sit-in outside the military headquarters insisting that the military hands over to a civilian administration. On Sunday, the Sudanese military dispersed protesters who had blocked a busy street in the capital, Khartoum. --BBC--
