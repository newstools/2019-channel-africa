Federer cruised through his opening match against Lorenzo Sonego on Sunday, and the 20-time Grand Slam champion is back on Court Philippe Chatrier to take on Otte. The 37-year-old won his only Roland Garros title in 2009 and is considered an outsider for the tournament this year, but will be a red-hot favourite against the world number 144 Otte - who claimed his first-ever Grand Slam match win against Malek Jaziri in round one. Federer may not be the same force on clay as he is on quicker courts, but has still been in decent form, reaching the Madrid and Rome quarter-finals. "I would be surprised if Roger knew my name," admitted Otte. Rafael Nadal (ESP x2) v Yannick Maden (GER) First meeting Nadal started his bid for a record-breaking 12th French Open title with a straightforward victory over German qualifier Yannick Hanfmann, and now finds himself facing another German qualifier named Yannick in world number 114 Maden. The Spaniard, who is just three behind Federer on the all-time list of Grand Slam titles with 17, has an incredible 87-2 win-loss record at Roland Garros. Maden, 29, played college tennis in the United States, and like Otte, had yet to register a win at the Slams until this tournament. "With YouTube you can find things," said Nadal of the potential pitfalls of facing the relative unknown of Maden. Nadal will, however, be playing a rare match on Roland Garros' second arena, Court Suzanne Lenglen.
