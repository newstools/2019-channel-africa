The 39-year-old Gayle has already announced that this global tournament will be the last time he will play 50-over internationals for the Caribbean side. The left-handed batsman is the most experienced member of the Windies' 15-man squad and will serve as deputy to captain Jason Holder. "It is always an honour to represent the West Indies in any format and this World Cup for me is special," said Gayle. "As a senior player, it is my responsibility to support the captain and everyone else in the team. "This will probably be the biggest World Cup, so there will be great expectations and I know we will do very well for the people of the West Indies." Gayle has scored 10 151 runs in 289 ODIs with a highest score of 2015 against Zimbabwe during the 2015 edition of the World Cup. The West Indies will start their World Cup campaign on May 31 when they play Pakistan at Trent Bridge. West Indies 15-man squad: Jason Holder (captain), Andre Russell, Ashley Nurse, Carlos Brathwaite, Chris Gayle, Darren Bravo, Evin Lewis, Fabian Allen, Kemar Roach, Nicholas Pooran, Oshane Thomas, Shai Hope, Shannon Gabriel, Sheldon Cottrell, Shimron Hetmyer
