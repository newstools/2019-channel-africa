The Ministry of Information says investigations are under way. In February, 24 illegal miners were killed when a dam burst, flooding a mine shaft just south of the capital, Harare. The miners are believed to have been working illegally in the South African-owned Jumbo mine. The Information Ministry says initial indications are that some miners exploded dynamite in one shaft, causing a collapse in an adjacent one. Illegal mining has increased in Zimbabwe, as commercial miners scale down operations because of an economic crisis. The mining methods are rudimentary and safety standards largely disregarded. --BBC--
