Jordaan made the promise during the send-off ceremony in honour of the South African Women’s soccer team, Banyana Banyana as they jet off to France for their first Fifa Women’s World Cup. Speaking at the send-off in Sandton on Thursday, Jordaan says, “When you come back (from the World Cup) we are launching the premier league for women’s football.” At a media presser on the sidelines, Jordaan promised that plans are in place to start the league at the beginning of August. "Teams have also agreed to sign players from outside the country; we already have interest from Zambia and Zimbabwe. From the legacy trust we have put aside $3 million as an investment to make sure that the league will be able to kick-off, probably on the 9th of August.” SAFA is making strides in "levelling the playing field" between the men’s and women’s game. He says they have upped the bonuses for Banyana Banyana and they will be paid the same as their male counterparts if they progress to the next round at the Fifa Women’s World Cup in France. --SABC--
