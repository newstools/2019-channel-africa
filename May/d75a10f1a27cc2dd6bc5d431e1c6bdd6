On the eve of European elections Britain had not expected to hold three years after the Brexit referendum, May urged lawmakers who have repeatedly rejected her plan to vote for it in early June so that the country can finally leave the bloc later in the summer. "The opportunity of Brexit is too large and the consequences of failure too grave to risk further delay," the prime minister, who has vowed to stand down following the crunch parliamentary vote, told the House of Commons. "Reject it and all we have before us is division and deadlock." May outlined a package of "compromise measures" aimed at securing the support of MPs from the main opposition Labour Party, which included giving parliament a vote on holding a referendum on her divorce deal. But Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, who last week pulled out of weeks of cross-party Brexit talks citing the government's unwillingness to compromise, said it was "little more than a repackaged version of her three-time rejected deal". "The rhetoric may have changed but the deal has not," he added. --AFP--
