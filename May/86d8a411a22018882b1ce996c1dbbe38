Khare placed Guelleh with Mohamed Abdi Hayir, the current Minister of Commerce and Industry of Somalia. Abdullahi Ali Hassan was appointed as the new Minister of Commerce and Industry of Somalia, replacing Hayir, according to PM’s degree. The quick move comes as country’s information minister Guelleh announced his resignation over strained relation between him and Prime Minister Khaire. However, Khaire’s cabinet has been hit by resignations as other ministers also resigned last year over what it was termed as “confusion and disorder”. Khaire is also facing huge pressure from political oppositions after some opposition parties reportedly filed separate complaint letters against Khaire. KNN radio based in Mogadishu has aired that President Mohamed had accepted to remove his Premier, Hassan Ali Khaire. Somalia has had no effective government since a coup removed Siad Barre from power in 1991, leading to an almost total breakdown in law and order. --AMISOM--
