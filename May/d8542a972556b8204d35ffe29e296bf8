Users can access simple on/off controls for Location History and Web & App Activity on their Google Account and delete all of that data manually. Google's new feature auto-delete controls make it even simpler for a user to manage their data. Users will choose a time limit for how long they want their activity data to be saved between 3 or 18 months. Data that is older than the selected time period will be automatically deleted from the users account on an on-going basis. The auto-delete feature is coming first to Location and Web & App Activity will roll out in the forthcoming weeks. In the blog, Google said that users would always be able to manage their data in a way thatÂ works best for the user and that they are committed to giving the user the best controls to make that happen. --IOL--
