This, as it tries to reduce power consumption through energy management regulations, an official has said. This comes amid indications that the country’s electrical power generation continues to decline while consumption of power continues to rise. In an interview, ZERA Senior Engineer, Samuel Zaranyika, said the energy regulator has invested over $150 000 in the exercise. “As ZERA, we have engaged Standards Association of Zimbabwe to certify the quality of electrical gadgets on the local market,” he said. “This is to make sure that all gadgets in the market are energy efficient. “We are also empowering SAZ by putting up a laboratory that will enable the organisation to test and verify all electrical gadgets before being sold. For the project, we have committed over $150 000 for the Association to buy appropriate equipment which will be used for the tests.” Eng Zaranyika said ZERA wanted to emulate the South African situation whereby South Africa Bureau of Standards (SABS) certifies all gadgets. “What it means is that, we are going the South African route whereby SABS certifies all gadgets before being sold,” he said. “When the lab is fully equipped, we will ask that everybody who sells gadgets on the Zimbabwean market must get gadgets certified first by SAZ. --The Herald --
