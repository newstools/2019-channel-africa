The board is likely to decide next week on whether to sign a non-binding agreement with FCA to proceed with its proposal to negotiate a full merger, the people said on Monday. FCA pitched a finely balanced merger of equals to Renault on Monday to create the world’s third-biggest automaker. Renault had for years tied its strategy to a partnership with Japanese automaker Nissan, but this has come into question after the arrest and subsequent ouster of Carlos Ghosn at both companies. After a board meeting over what it termed a "friendly" offer, Renault said it would enter talks on a merger that would create additional value while bolstering its manufacturing footprint. Investors cheered the prospect, with Renault’s shares soaring 15% in midday trading in Paris, and Fiat Chrysler stock up more than 10% in Milan. The tie-up would forge the world’s third-largest automaker, giving Fiat access in particular to Renault’s electric car technologies. Renault, for its part, could get access to Fiat Chrysler’s extensive United States operations and its expertise in trucks and SUVs. The idea has the backing of the French government, which owns a 15% stake in Renault, after Fiat said the merger would not result in the closure of any production sites.
