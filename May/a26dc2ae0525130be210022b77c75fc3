The Robben Island Museum in Cape Town said the new entrance fee would be R550 ($38; £29) for non-South African adults and R300 ($20.65) for children. For South African adults it would be R380 ($26.16) and R200 ($13.77) for children. "We believe that this decision will have a positive turnaround on our long term financial sustainability as an organisation whilst also contributing to an increase in domestic visitors,” the museum's Chief Financial Officer, Blayne Crocker, said in a statement. --BBC--
