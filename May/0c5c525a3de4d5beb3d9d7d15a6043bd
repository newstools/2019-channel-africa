Ethiopia’s government announced the approval in a Facebook post on Wednesday after a meeting of the council of East African ministers. South Sudan had faced a May 12 deadline for opposition leader Riek Machar to return to the country and once again become President Salva Kiir’s deputy. It is the crucial next step in a fragile peace deal to end a five-year civil war that killed nearly 400 000 people. Both South Sudan’s government and Machar’s opposition requested the six-month extension last week. The committee overseeing the peace deal’s implementation says key elements have yet to be put in place.  --Africa News--
