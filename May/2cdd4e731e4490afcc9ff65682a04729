Liverpool coach, Jurgen Klopp, has revealed that Keïta has a high-grade adductor injury and will be out for two months and as such, is a huge doubt for the 2019 Africa Cup of Nations (AFCON). Keïta was taken off midway through the first half of Liverpool's 3-0 loss to Barcelona in the first leg of their UEFA Champions League semi-final clash at Camp Nou, Spain. The midfielder sustained a knock after being hauled down by, Barcelona attacking midfielder, Ivan Rakitic. However, he continued to play before he eventually had to be taken off. Klopp told the media in Europe, "It was really unlucky, bad news, high-grade adductor injury. The tendon is ruptured, will keep him out for at least two months”. He further said, “Bad news for us and for Guinea with the Africa Cup of Nations coming up. Not nice.” The news comes as a huge blow to AFCON -bound Guinea. Injuries and inconsistency had stunted the growth of the midfielder at the Anfield outfit, having arrived in the summer as a $62 million signing. Guinea is in Group B of the AFCON 2019 alongside Madagascar, Nigeria and Burundi.  --Goal--
