The court in Somalia's northern semi-autonomous state of Puntland acquitted seven others. The girl was abducted from a market in Galkayo town in February. Her body was discovered the next morning and a post-mortem found that that she had been strangled to death after being gang-raped. The atrocity led to street protests as well as an angry reaction on social media with calls for the Puntland government to take action. --BBC--
