Symptoms in humans of monkeypox; which is endemic in parts of Central and Western Africa, include lesions, fever, muscle ache and chills.
Transmission is usually via close contact with infected animals such as rodents and monkeys and is limited between people. It has only been fatal in rare cases. Ministry of Health (MOH) said in a statement late Thursday that the man who brought in the virus arrived in Singapore on April 28. The ministry further said, the 38-year-old developed symptoms two days later and is currently isolated at an infectious disease center in a stable condition. At least 23 individuals who have been in close contact with the man have been traced, and those who are in Singapore will be quarantined and monitored for 21 days as a precaution. One had already left Singapore on May 5 before the Nigerian was diagnosed at hospital but has since made contact with the City’s Health Authorities and has reported he is well. Executive Director of Singapore’s National Centre for Infectious Diseases, Leo Yee Sin said, “The risk of community spread of monkeypox in Singapore is low”. He added that on average, “Each infected person transmits the infection to less than one other person”, which makes the virus less infectious than the common flu. --Vanguard ngr--
