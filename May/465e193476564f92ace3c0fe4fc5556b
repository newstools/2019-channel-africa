Europe kicked off voting across the continent in a contest in which rising populist forces are hoping to make significant gains, threatening closer Europe Union integration. Britain's EU poll is an ironic twist for a country that decided almost three years ago to leave the bloc and whose leader had vowed to avoid the vote. "The markets (are) caught in a perfect storm of UK political turmoil, US-China trade warmongering and European economic softness," said Spreadex analyst Connor Campbell. London's FTSE 100 shares index was down 1.4% in afternoon deals as the government postponed a crucial Brexit vote following an outcry from hardline Brexiteers over concessions made by May, who faces intense speculation over her future. The pound forged another four-month low as May faces being ousted after a revised plan to push through her Brexit agreement, which sparked the resignation of cabinet member Andrea Leadsom. Eurozone indices took a battering also on Thursday, with Frankfurt and Paris losing 1.5 percent or more as survey data showed the bloc's economic growth remained "subdued" in May. "The last thing the market needed on Thursday was a reminder of the eurozone's manufacturing and services sector woes," added Campbell. --AFP--
