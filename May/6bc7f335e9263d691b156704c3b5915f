The Premier Soccer League (PSL), South African Football Association (SAFA), South African Football Players Union (SAFPU), and the Confederation of African Football (CAF) are all amongst the sporting bodies that are set to argue against the amended Sport Broadcasting Service Regulations put forward in December 2018. ICASA accepted written submissions from stakeholders until March this year and have now invited 27 of these bodies to give oral representations of their submissions at a public hearing that will be held at the African Pride Irene Country Lodge in Pretoria, South Africa between May 27 and 31 this year. The proposed regulations amendments, in brief, state that all sports of national interest and importance are to be beamed on free-to-air channels across the country, in an effort to aid the cash-strapped the public broadcaster, South African Broadcasting Corporation (SABC) and combat South Africa-based Pan-Africa group of television channels, SuperSport’s dominance over sports broadcasting in South Africa. However, as stated in a press conference held by the Premier Soccer League (PSL) in January, this could have a major impact on several sporting bodies’ revenue, as broadcast rights have become a major stream of income in recent years. PSL Chairperson, Irvin Khoza, even went as far as threatening to shut the League down, should these amendments be brought into effect, as this would result in a loss of billions of Rands from their current broadcast deal with SuperSport. CAF are first up on the podium and will present on May 28, before the PSL appear the following day. SAFPU will kick-off proceedings on May 29, proceeded by SASCOC, with SAFA then wrapping up the day.
