The 41-year-old comedian was sworn in as Ukraine's youngest post-Soviet president a month after scoring a landslide victory over Petro Poroshenko with a campaign capitalising on widespread public discontent with the political establishment. Zelensky whose only previous political experience is appearing as president in a popular TV show -- announced his first priority was ending the five-year conflict with Moscow-backed separatists in the industrial east that has claimed over 13 000 lives. "Our first task is a ceasefire in the Donbass," Zelensky said during the ceremony in parliament, referring to the eastern separatist-controlled region, prompting a round of applause. "We didn't start this war but it is up to us to end it," he said. "We are ready for dialogue," he added, urging the handover of Ukrainian prisoners.
