It is set to be the highest scoring World Cup of all time with the host nation expected to produce flat, dry and quick wickets, but the Proteas are one of the few sides going into the competition backing their bowlers. If everybody is fit then the pace trio of Dale Steyn, Kagiso Rabada and Lungi Ngidi will likely be given the job of taking on England in the May 30 tournament opener at The Oval, while Imran Tahir will operate as South Africa's specialist spinner. It is in those four bowlers where South Africa are hoping to find their successes, even if scores of over 300 are likely to be considered 'par' at the tournament. "Even if your focus is on setting scores like 350, if you've got a bowling attack that can bowl sides out for 280, then that changes things completely," Du Plessis told media in Johannesburg last week ahead of the side's departure for England. That's a huge weapon of ours. "People are saying that the wickets are great, and the scores say that too, but I honestly do believe that we are going there with a very powerful bowling attack. Whatever the batters get, we believe that the bowlers can defend that." That said, Du Plessis does know the importance of having big, clean hitters that can take scores well out past 300. "All batters who have the potential to be your big hitters play a hug role," he said. "We're like that we have Dave (Miller), JP (Duminy), myself when I'm in and Quinton (De Kock) is a guy who does that at the top. "We've got X-factor and explosivity in our batting line-up and that's what posts you the big scores." --News24--
