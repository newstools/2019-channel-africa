In an escalation of the trade conflict between the two countries, state media on Wednesday implied China could restrict rare earth sales to the US, stoking fears about Beijing’s role as a supplier. Although, according to US Geological Survey data, China contains only a third of the world’s rare earth reserves, it accounts for 80% of US imports of the group of 17 minerals used in military equipment and high-tech consumer electronics. That is largely due to China’s domination in processing. Efforts to build rare earth processing plants in the United States are still in the early stages and lack unified support from Congress and the administration of US President Donald Trump. At least three US-based companies have rare earth processing plants under construction or in the planning stages. One is set to open next year at Mountain Pass mine, California, when it will become the sole operating rare earth processor in the US. It is set to produce about 5 000 tons of two popular types of rare earth annually, according to a source familiar with the matter. The other two are not expected to open until 2022 at the earliest. --Reuters--
