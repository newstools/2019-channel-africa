The United Nation's International Labour Organization found in a fresh study that companies that improve gender diversity in their management report significant profit increases. "Gender diversity is a smart business strategy," according to the report, which based its findings on a survey of nearly 13 000 companies across 70 countries. According to the survey, nearly three-quarters of companies that tracked gender diversity in their management reported profit hikes of between five and 20%. And some 57% said growing the number of women at the top made it easier to attract and retain talent, while nearly as many said they saw improvements in creativity, innovation and openness, and an enhancement of the company's reputation. The report also analysed data from 186 countries between 1991 and 2017, and found that increasing women's employment is associated with more economic growth at the national level. "These results are eye-opening," said Deborah France-Massin, who heads ILO's employers' activity bureau. "Companies should look at gender balance as a bottom-line issue, not just a human resources issue," she said in a statement. Gender balance in senior management is defined as 40-60% of either gender, and the ILO said the beneficial effects of gender diversity begin to kick in when women hold at least 30% of senior management and leadership positions. But it warned that nearly 60% of the companies surveyed acknowledged that they did not meet this target. And in nearly half of the companies surveyed, women accounted for less than one on three of entry-level management recruits. --AFP--
