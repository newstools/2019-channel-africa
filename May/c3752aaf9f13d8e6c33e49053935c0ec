While the country is the continent's most industrialised economy with its most developed infrastructure, it is grappling with stagnating growth and unemployment levels creeping towards 30%, rising over 50% among the young. Rampant corruption, ballooning national debt and depressed investor confidence have weighed down the potential of the country under the African National Congress (ANC), which has ruled since the end of apartheid and is widely tipped to win again, polling at more than 50% of the vote. Its closest challenger, the opposition Democratic Alliance, is forecast to get only about 20%. After May 8, the President, likely to be incumbent Ramaphosa as ANC leader will have a tough task creating jobs, attracting foreign money and tackling corruption. Soaring fuel prices, a weak local currency and persistent inequalities further add to the socio-economic malaise. "Persistently low growth and high unemployment rates are key economic challenges," according to global investment ratings agency Moody's. South Africa's economy grew at less than 1% in 2018 and slipped into a brief recession during the third quarter of 2018. Discontent at poor basic services such as water, housing and electricity have sparked a wave of protests, with violent crime further fuelling public anger. --AFP--
