The office director said officers from various security branches arrived and informed them of the TMC decision to close the office and seize its belongings. Six weeks after a coup d’etat in Sudan, high-profile military leader, General Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo, is evolving into an increasingly influential political force. The involvement of so powerful a military chief in politics could undermine efforts to create a democracy in the northeast African country and provoke army officers who are wary of his ambitions, opponents and Western diplomats say. Dagalo, commonly known as Hemedti, is Deputy Chairperson of Transitional Military Council that has been running Sudan since President Omar Hassan al-Bashir’s fall in April. Unlike junta leader, Lieutenant General Abdel Fattah al-Burhan, Hemedti has grabbed the limelight, often delivering speeches in public as Sudan navigates a volatile transition period after a 30-year dictatorship.
