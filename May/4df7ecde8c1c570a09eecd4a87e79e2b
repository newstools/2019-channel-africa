The company had reported earnings before interest and taxation (EBIT) of 79.3 billion Shillings ($784 million) in the previous year. Safaricom, which is partly owned by South Africa’s Vodacom and Britain’s Vodafone, said rapid growth in M-Pesa digital financial business had offset a sharp slowdown in the growth of its internet access provision business. Revenue from the data business grew by 6.4% during the year, plunging from a growth on 24% a year earlier, Sateesh Kamath, the company’s Chief Financial Officer, told an investors’ briefing. M-Pesa was launched more than a decade ago to offer Kenyans without bank accounts a network to transfer cash via mobile phones. It now offers a range of payment services, loans and savings to more than 21 million people in Kenya and has been copied abroad. The company, which is the most profitable in East Africa, said it expected EBIT to rise to 93-97 billion Shillings ($920-959 million) in its financial year to the end of next March. It boosted its dividend per share for the year to 1.25 Shillings ($0.012), and proposed a special dividend of 0.62 Shillings ($0.0061). ($1 = 100.75 Kenyan Shillings) --Reuters--
