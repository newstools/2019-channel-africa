His comment come after he announced a new reduced executive with the number of ministers declining from 36 to 28 and half of the ministers are women. Ramaphosa says: “Their performance individually and collectively will be closely monitored against specific outcomes. I will be signing performance agreements with each and every one of the ministers and deputy ministers which will be evaluated regularly against clearly stated targets and clearly stated performance outcomes. And where implementation is unsatisfactory, action will be taken.” He says it’s the first time in South Africa that half the ministers are women. Pravin Gordhan retains his post as Public Enterprises Minister, despite the Public Protector making findings against him. David Mabuza stays on as Deputy President. Ramaphosa says competence, continuity, regional diversity and gender were among the considerations when selecting his executive.
