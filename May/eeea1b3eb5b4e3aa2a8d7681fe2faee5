The president took his oath of office in traditional dress, simple white robes and an embroidered hat. "I do solemnly swear that I will be faithful and bear true allegiance to the Federal Republic of Nigeria," he said. "I will preserve, protect and defend the constitution." Buhari's to-do list includes reviving a weak economy and tackling rampant corruption and insecurity. --BBC--
