Modi’s pro-business image and India’s youthful population have lured foreign investors, with United States firms such as Amazon.com, Walmart and Mastercard committing billions of dollars in investments and ramping up hiring. India is also the biggest market by users for firms such as Facebook Inc, and its subsidiary, WhatsApp. But from around 2017, critics say, the Hindu nationalist leader took a harder, protectionist line on sectors such as e-commerce and technology, crafting some policies that appeared to aim at whipping up patriotic fervour ahead of elections. "I hope he’s now back to wooing businesses," said Prasanto Roy, a technology policy analyst based in New Delhi, who advises global tech firms. "Global firms remain deeply concerned about the lack of policy stability or predictability; this has sent a worrying message to global investors." --Reuters--
