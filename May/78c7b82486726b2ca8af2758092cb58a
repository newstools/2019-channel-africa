According to Ghana's Ministry of Food and Agriculture, the ban will take effect next week and will last indefinitely. The ban comes in the wake of an European Union (EU) directive to all countries to provide a report on the management of harmful bacteria. The Vegetable Producers and Exporters Association of Ghana has asked the government to postpone the ban, arguing it will affect the businesses of about 4000 farmers. But the authorities want to avoid restrictions being imposed by the EU, which only lifted its last ban on contaminated vegetables from Ghana last year. --BBC--
