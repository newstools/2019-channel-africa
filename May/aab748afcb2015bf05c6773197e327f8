The regulator, the Uganda Communications Commission (UCC), did not specify cases of alleged breaches in the directive sent to the 13 media houses, including NBS Television, Bukedde TV, NTV, CBS FM and Capital FM. It ordered the suspension of producers, heads of news and heads of programmes within three days. "This follows concerns over the nature of content aired on these broadcast stations particularly during live programmes, breaking news, and main news bulletins which do not comply with the Minimum broadcasting standards," the UCC added. --BBC--
