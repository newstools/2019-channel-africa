Liverpool went into the match at Anfield trailing 3-0 from the first leg and deprived of injured star attacking duo Mohamed Salah and Roberto Firmino. However, Origi, making a rare start and substitute Wijnaldum both netted twice as Barca for the second season in succession surrendered a three-goal first-leg lead to exit the Champions League. "With any other team I wouldn’t think it was possible. They are really mentality giants," Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp said. "It is unbelievable the season we had, the games we had, the injuries we had now. "Going out there and putting in a performance like this on the pitch is unbelievable. I am really proud to be the manager of this team. "What they did tonight was really special. I will remember it forever." Liverpool will face either Dutch side Ajax or Premier League rivals Tottenham in the final on June 1 in Madrid and will likely be favourites to be crowned European champions for the sixth time. The Reds’ stunning victory brought back memories of when they last lifted the trophy in 2005 when they overturned a 3-0 half-time deficit in the final against AC Milan in Istanbul. However, Klopp underlined the importance of his side writing their own history even if their bid for a first Premier League title for 29 years falls short behind Manchester City this weekend.
