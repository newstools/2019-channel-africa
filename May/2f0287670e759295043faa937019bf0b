Folau's future remains unclear after the code of conduct hearing into Rugby Australia's intention to fire the 30-year-old was extended to a third day, following a stalemate over the weekend. It will resume on Tuesday. The governing body wants the devoutly Christian player out of the game after he posted on social media that "hell awaits" gay people and other sinners, following a similar tirade last year. Folau, who now looks certain to miss 2019 Rugby World Cup, has been unrepentant, insisting his life was dedicated to God, and his father Eni supported his right to cite passages from the Bible. "Israel does not do any wrong at all," he was quoted on Monday as telling reporters at a Pentecostal service he led on Sunday at a Sydney church. "All the words he posted up has not come from him, it's come from the Bible. "I talked to him, and he said whatever God's decision to his life, he will accept." Folau, Wallabies coach Michael Cheika, and Rugby Australia chief Raelene Castle has all given evidence at the hearing, along with NSW Rugby boss Andrew Hore. --News24--
