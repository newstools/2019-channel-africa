Africa’s biggest mobile-phone company could go ahead with the placing on May 16, said the people, who asked not to be named as the matter is private. The move could be delayed as some steps required by the Nigerian Stock Exchange still have to be completed, they said. "We don’t have a specific date, we are looking at some time before the end of this quarter," Tobechukwu Okigbo, MTN Nigeria’s head of corporate relations, said by phone. MTN Nigeria registered 20.35 billion ordinary shares with the country’s Securities and Exchange Commission this week. It plans to list around 20% of those on the bourse.That would give the unit a market value of as much as $5.1 billion, making it the second-biggest public firm in Africa’s main oil producer after Dangote Cement. It will be the largest when measured by revenue. MTN agreed to an initial public offering of its Nigeria business as part of the settlement of a reduced $1 billion fine in the country in 2016. --News24--
