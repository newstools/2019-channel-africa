There is also prize money up for grabs for each of the 45 league matches, with sides pocketing $40 000 every time they secure victory in their nine group stage matches. The six sides that do not progress out of the league phase will earn $100 000 each. The Proteas will play the May 30 tournament opener when they take on hosts and favourites England. --news24--
