While opposition parties refused to concede and the country faces a nerve-jangling three day wait until the official count begins, most media polls said Modi's Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and its allies would secure enough seats to form a new government after the world's biggest election. The seven rounds of voting over six weeks ended on Sunday with about 65 percent of the 900 eligible voters taking part, the election commission said. India's share and currency markets soared on the back of the polls. The Bombay Stock Exchange Sensex index had its biggest one-day gain in nearly six years, 3.75% to close at a record high 39.352 points while the Indian rupee strengthened to 69.63 to the dollar from its Friday close of 70.22. Traders called the polls boost to Modi a vital sign of stability for one of the world's fastest growing major economies. "This ends a significant political uncertainty," said Sujan Hajra, an economist at Anand Rathi securities in Mumbai. Modi fought an acrimonious campaign framed around his tough national security stance rather than the economy. The opposition had attacked his handling of India's finances particularly the withdrawal of most cash notes in 2016 and new taxes. --AFP--
