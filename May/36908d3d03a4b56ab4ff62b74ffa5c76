With just over a fifth of voting districts tallied, the Election Commission put the ANC well ahead, with its closest rival the Democratic Alliance trailing with a distant 26%. The Economic Freedom Fighters, founded six years ago by former ANC youth leader Julius Malema, was sitting at 8%. Ramaphosa, 66, took over in 2018 after the ANC forced then-President Jacob Zuma to resign after nine years dominated by corruption allegations and economic problems. The party that wins the most seats in parliament selects the country's President, who will be sworn in on May 25.

"The outcome of this election will be a major boost for investors... and investor confidence, it's about confidence and about the future," Ramaphosa said after voting on Wednesday. The ANC's reputation was badly sullied under Zuma. Support for the ANC has fallen in every election since 2004 with the party taking 54% in 2016 municipal elections, compared with 62% in 2014's national vote.
