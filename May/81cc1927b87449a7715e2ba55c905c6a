The world number two holds an incredible French Open win-loss record of 86-2, and hit top form by winning his ninth Italian Open last week with a final victory over old rival Novak Djokovic. Nadal could move to within two titles of Roger Federer's all-time men's record of 20 Grand Slam trophies if he lifts the Coupe des Mousquetaires on June 9. "I don't care if I'm the favourite," he said. "I care about feeling well and playing well. "I appreciate that you (the media) see me like that, but (Dominic) Thiem, Novak (Djokovic), Federer, Tsitsipas who has been playing well, (Juan Martin) del Potro, (Kei) Nishikori , all those that are the best in the world will be favourites. "The only thing that worries me is being well and being competitive.The only favourite that matters is the one who has the cup at home in two weeks' time." Before his triumph in Rome, it had been far from a trademark clay-court season for Nadal. The Spaniard failed in his bids for 12th titles in both Monte Carlo and Barcelona, where he lost in the semi-finals to Fabio Fognini and Thiem respectively. Another last-four exit followed on home soil in Madrid against Greek rising star Tsitsipas. Nadal admits it took him time to rediscover his top form after a one-month absence with the right knee injury which forced him to withdraw from Indian Wells before a scheduled semi-final against Federer. --AFP--
