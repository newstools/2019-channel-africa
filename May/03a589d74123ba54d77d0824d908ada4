Edgar Zambrano, vice president of the opposition-controlled National Assembly, which Guaido heads, said on Twitter that agents from the SEBIN intelligence agency were using a tow truck to drag his vehicle, with him inside, to one of their Caracas bases. On Tuesday, Venezuela’s pro-Maduro Constituent Assembly ruled to strip Zambrano, and six other lawmakers, of their parliamentary immunity to allow their future prosecution. The Supreme Court had earlier accused the lawmakers of conspiracy, rebellion and treason, and on Wednesday accused three other opposition legislators of the same crimes. The opposition says Maduro has stacked the court with his own supporters, and the US government this week threatened to sanction all its members. An attempted uprising last week led by Guaido, recognised as the legitimate head of state by the United States and other Western countries, failed to dislodge Maduro, as have a series of US sanctions against his government. Maduro decried the events as an attempted coup. "One of the principal conspirators of the coup has just been arrested," Diosdado Cabello, head of the Constituent Assembly, said in comments broadcast on state television. "They will have to pay before the courts for the failed coup that they attempted," he said. Zambrano said on Twitter that SEBIN agents had surrounded his vehicle by the headquarters of his Democratic Action party in Caracas’ La Florida district. "We were surprised by the SEBIN, and after refusing to let us leave our vehicle, they used a tow truck to forcibly transfer us directly to the (SEBIN headquarters) Helicoide," he said. It was not yet clear if Zambrano was already at the Helicoide. "The regime has kidnapped the first vice president," Guaido said on Twitter. Guaido in January invoked the constitution to assume an interim presidency, denouncing Maduro as illegitimate after he secured re-election last year in a vote widely viewed as fraudulent. The Constituent Assembly removed Guaido’s parliamentary immunity in early April, but authorities have not tried to arrest him since then.
