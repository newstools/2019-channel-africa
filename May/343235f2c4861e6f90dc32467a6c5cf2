"We sincerely regret any confusion and misunderstanding this incident might have caused," the statement said. Somalia had been completely erased from the map, but the self-declared territory of Somaliland which is not internationally recognised was shown. The map has caused uproar on social media. The mistake is especially sensitive as Ethiopia and Somalia have long been rivals and have fought border wars, including the Ogaden conflict in the 1970s. Relations between the two countries have improved since Ethiopia's Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed came to power last year as he has sought to defuse tensions in the region. But some Somalis on social media said the map revealed a wider plan by Ethiopia to annex their country. Others hit back, with their own version of a map of Africa, incorporating Ethiopia into Somalia. Some have noticed other problems with the map published on the Ethiopian website, for example, it showed that the Republic of Congo and the Democratic Republic of Congo had become one country and it did not show South Sudan, which split from Sudan in 2011. The Ethiopian foreign ministry said it was unsure how the “unacceptable” map had “crept in on the website”, which is currently offline, but said its technical team was working to ensure its security. --BBC--
