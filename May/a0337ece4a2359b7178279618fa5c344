Coca-Cola was named the fourth most admired brand in Africa based on the opinions spontaneously recalled by consumers and was also named category leader for non-alcoholic beverages, ahead of Pepsi Cola and Fanta. In total, three of the company’s brands, namely Coca-Cola, Fanta and Sprite, appeared in the top 100 brands across the continent. The Brand Africa 100 ranking is based on a survey among consumers aged 18 years and older, conducted across 23 African countries. These cover all economic regions and collectively account for 80 % of the continent's population and gross domestic product. “A large part of building brands that people love, is following our values and working towards solutions that benefit everyone," Coca-Cola head of communications for southern and East Africa Camilla Osborne said. "To help solve many of the world’s challenges, we apply a few foundational principles to make measurable, meaningful differences." The Coca-Cola Company offers over 500 brands in more than 200 countries and territories and with its bottling partners employs more than 700 000 people around the world. --IOL--
