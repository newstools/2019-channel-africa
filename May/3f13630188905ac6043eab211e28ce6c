Chiyoda, one of the worldâ€™s leading builders of liquefied natural gas (LNG) plants, has struggled with losses after a hurricane hit its Cameron LNG project in Louisiana. However, a global shift from coal is seen boosting the demand for natural gas, and Royal Dutch Shell has forecast the global LNG trade to rise 11% to 354 million tonnes this year. Mitsubishi has said it expects such growth to also fuel a rise in LNG projects. Mitsubishi, which has bailed out Chiyoda twice already and has a 33.4% stake in the engineering company, will provide the bulk of the $1.36 billion lifeline through a private placement of new preferred shares and loans, the report said, without citing sources. MUFG Bank, a part of Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group, will provide additional financing, it said. Chiyoda said it was in talks, but no decision had yet been made. It also said its full-year loss would likely be bigger than it previously forecast.
