The loss has dealt a heavy blow to coach Thabo Senong’s lads who still need to face Portugal and the Korean Republic in Group F. The stage was too big for South Africa who were making their debut in the World Cup. Argentina has tasted success down the years winning the World Cup six times. Against minnows South Africa, the South Americans had an opportunity to win maximum points and they did that with a well taken corner kick. Amajita leveled matters through Keenan Philips after he connected a well taken set piece. South Africa were dealt a heavy blow in the second half after a foul in the box and had to go through the Video Assistant Referee (VAR), which proved it was a penalty. The goal completely shifted Amajita’s focus and as if that was not enough, Philips was yellow carded for rough play but after his case was referred to VAR, he got his marching orders. From there on it was one way traffic as Argentina scored three more goals. South Africa tried to catch the Argentinians with a counter attack. Amajita tried to use striker Lyle Foster as their danger man but he was out numbered. South Africa’s next match will be against the Korean Republic on Tuesday. --ThembaShiba--
