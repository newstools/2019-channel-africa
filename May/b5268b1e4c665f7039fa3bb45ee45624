FedEx said it will offer year-round, seven-day United States ground delivery starting in January 2020. It now offers Sunday home delivery in the US only during the peak holiday season. Memphis-based FedEx and rivals ranging from United Parcel Service Inc to Amazon.com Inc are seeking to reduce the cost of delivering packages the so-called “last mile” to online shoppers’ doorsteps by increasing the number of packages they drop of at each stop. "We’re going to be the premium, low-cost delivery provider" for the last mile, said Raj Subramaniam, FedEx’s president and chief operating officer. FedEx aims to do that by shifting the delivery of nearly 2 million FedEx SmartPost packages from US Post Office (USPS) mail carriers to the service providers who handle FedEx Ground residential package deliveries. FedEx since 2016 has used technology that allows it to put a FedEx SmartPost package into the FedEx Ground network when another package is destined for the same or nearby address. It is accelerating that matching effort and expects the vast majority of FedEx SmartPost package volume to be integrated into FedEx Ground operations for final delivery by the end of 2020. Shares in FedEx closed down 1% at $158.01 on Thursday.
