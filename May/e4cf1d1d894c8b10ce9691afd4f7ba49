Ford Chief Executive Officer Jim Hackett said in an email to employees that the cuts include both voluntary buyouts and layoffs, and a spokesman added it freezes open positions as well. About 2300 of the affected people are employed in the United States, the spokesman said. "To succeed in our competitive industry, and position Ford to win in a fast-changing future, we must reduce bureaucracy, empower managers, speed decision making, focus on the most valuable work and cut costs,": Hackett said in the email. Ford has been restructuring its operations globally to improve profitability and speed product development, making or announcing cuts in Europe, South America and Russia. --Reuters--
