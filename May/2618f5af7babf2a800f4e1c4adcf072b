The final 55 billion Naira ($152 million) payment from MTN, Africa’s largest telecommunications firm, to the Nigerian government is due at the end of the month, the Nigerian Communications Commission said in a statement. MTN was originally fined 1.04 trillion Naira ($2.8 billion) for failing to deactivate more than 5 million unregistered SIM cards, but it negotiated a reduced fine to clear its path to list its subsidiary on the Nigerian Stock Exchange. Last week, shares began trading on the Nigerian Stock Exchange in Lagos in a 2 trillion Naira ($5.5 billion) flotation that marked the exchange’s second-largest stock by market value.
