In October, Germany decided to reject future arms exports licenses to Saudi Arabia over the killing of journalist Jamal Khashoggi, and to freeze deliveries of already approved equipment - a move that infuriated allies and defence companies. Airbus is looking at taking legal action against Berlin over the security system for the border between Saudi Arabia and Yemen - a contract worth some $3.36 billion. "We are looking at an action for failure to act," said one source familiar with the matter, speaking on Sunday on condition of anonymity. "We want to force the federal government to decide now." Airbus declined to comment. The German government has said it could not comment on any potential corporate compensation claims as a result of the Saudi arms export ban until any materialise. It was not immediately clear where in Germany or when any lawsuit would be filed. In late March, Germany extended the ban on arms exports to Saudi Arabia until the end of September, with a few exceptions. The border system for Saudi Arabia consists of radars, drones and command posts for guards.
