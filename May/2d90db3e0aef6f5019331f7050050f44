Telecoms giant EE, owned by BT, was due to bring Huawei's first 5G phone, the Huawei Mate 20X, to Britain, but the Chinese giant's involvement in the country's telecoms has become politically controversial. EE chief executive Marc Allera said that the company had "paused" the launch of Huawei's 5G phones "until we get the information and confidence and the long-term security that our customers... are going to be supported". The group also said it would phase out the use of Huawei equipment in its network infrastructure. Vodafone soon followed suit, announcing it was suspending pre-orders of Huawei 5G handsets. "We are pausing pre-orders for the Huawei Mate 20X in the UK. This is a temporary measure while uncertainty exists regarding new Huawei 5G devices," said a spokesperson. KDDI and SoftBank Corp, Japan's number two and number three carriers respectively, said the decision was taken to give them time to assess the impact of a US ban on American companies selling technology to Huawei. The country's biggest carrier, NTT Docomo, also announced it was suspending pre-orders for a new Huawei handset, but stopped short of halting the release itself.

Citing national security, US President Donald Trump has effectively banned US companies from supplying Huawei and affiliates with the critical components that have helped it grow into the world's largest supplier of telecom networking equipment and second-biggest smartphone maker. US officials this week, however, issued a 90-day reprieve on the ban on dealing with Huawei, saying breathing space is needed to avoid huge disruption. British chipmaker ARM, whose designs form the basis of most mobile device processors worldwide, is also set to cut ties with Huawei, according to the BBC, as its products contain "US-origin technology" that would be affected by the ban. --AFP--
