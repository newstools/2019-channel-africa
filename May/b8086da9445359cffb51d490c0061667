According to the caucus, the renegotiated deal is not in the interest of Ghana as the country's stake in the oil field has been reduced from 43% to 18%, a reduction of 58%. At a press conference in Parliament on Sunday, the Minority, which described the deal as a ‘sell off’ said, "The impact from the Annual General Meeting (AGM)/Aker Energy is huge, a potential loss of over 250 million barrels of recoverable oil production equivalent which is almost the size of the entire Jubilee (Oli)Field." The issue of Aker Energy and the South Deepwater Tano Contract Area, came to the forefront a fortnight ago when policy think tank, Imani Africa, claimed that Ghana could lose as much as $14 billion if it did not take steps to renegotiate the deal. The government, however, in a rebuttal, said Imani was misinformed on the matter. Energy Minister, John Peter Amewu, clarifying the issue said the Petroleum Agreement covering the Dividend Withholding Tax / Compulsory Third Party contract area operated by Aker Energy was executed on February 8, 2006, between the Government of Ghana, the Ghana National Petroleum Corporation (GNPC), AMERADA HESS Corporation, Lukoil and Fueltrade. Iddrisu, further said that the impact of the renegotiation, amounting to almost 25% of Ghana's equity interest to AGM/Aker Energy, in an area that has a potential of about one to two billion barrels of recoverable reserves of oil was huge financial loss to the state. -- All Africa--
