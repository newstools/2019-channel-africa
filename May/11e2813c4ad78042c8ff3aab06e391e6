In a statement on Wednesday the authority said the South African Transport and Allied Workers Union has placed it on notice for a strike over salary discrepancies. The authority manages South Africa's eight commercial ports. The union previously said it has received a strike certificate and was planning a "total shutdown of the country’s ports". Union spokesperson, Zanele Sabela, said Satawu members were planning to stop work due to salary discrepancies between black and white mariners. White mariners draw higher salaries than their black counterparts, even when they have less experience," said the union in a media release. Sabela told Fin24 that the union suggested a third party be brought in to investigate the wage gap, but that TNPA did not follow through on this.
