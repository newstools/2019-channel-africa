South Africans started voting in parliamentary and provincial elections, with queues seen winding from various polling stations. Polling stations will close at 9 pm. The exact timing of results is uncertain. "I am a member of the ANC but I didn't vote for them this time," said Thabo Makhene, 32, who works in construction at a polling station in the commercial hub of Johannesburg. "They need to catch a wake-up. The way they run the state, mishandling state funds, they have lost their morals." The national election is the first under President Cyril Ramaphosa, who replaced scandal-plagued Jacob Zuma as head of state in February 2018 after four years as Zuma's deputy.
