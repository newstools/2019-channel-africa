Earlier in May, the largest German automaker won its bid to put off a union election for 1700 workers at the Chattanooga plant until its challenge to a smaller United Auto Workers bargaining unit at the factory is settled. The National Labor Relations Board in a single-sentence, 2-1 decision on May 3 granted Volkswagen’s motion to stay an election petition filed by some of its workers in April. Senators Gary Peters and Debbie Stabenow of Michigan and Sherrod Brown of Ohio wrote to Scott Keogh, president of Volkswagen Group of America, on Tuesday, expressing "deep concern with delays" to the election. "We urge you to immediately drop any efforts to oppose or postpone the election," the said.

UAW spokesman Brian Rothenberg said: "Chattanooga workers just want the right to vote and have the same workplace rights as every other VW worker in the world." Volkswagen did not immediately comment Tuesday. In December 2015, 160 skilled trade maintenance workers voted to unionize and affiliate with the UAW, the union said. VW declined to bargain with the union, saying the unit needed to include both skilled trade maintenance workers and production workers.
