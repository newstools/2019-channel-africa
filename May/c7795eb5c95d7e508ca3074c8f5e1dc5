Du Plessis previously played for Lancashire on a Kolpak deal from 2008-2010 and according to De Villiers was considering a second county stint shortly after his debut in 2011. "He (Faf) waited a bit longer. It happened quite quickly for me, a couple of doors opened up and I put my hand up at the right time," De Villiers said in an interview on Indian YouTube show, Breakfast with Champions. "I think he was mentally in a great space when he made his debut. There was a moment where he was thinking of signing a Kolpak deal with an English county. "He called me up and asked me what I thought about it. I said that 'not a long time from now there'll be a few retirements and you're pretty close and the coaches and the team are talking about you. So just hang in there a little bit longer'. And finally the breakthrough came. "I'm not taking credit for that, but we did have that conversation. I'm very happy I was straight up (with him)," ended De Villiers. Du Plessis will lead the Proteas in next week's Cricket World Cup in England and Wales. The Proteas open their campaign against the hosts, England on Thursday, May 30.
