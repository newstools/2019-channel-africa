A total $1.8 million package of support will be aimed for creative industries in Kenya and Nigeria. The Foreign Secretary, Jeremy Hunt, has welcomed over $83.9 million of funding for Kenyan businesses on the final day of his week-long visit to Africa. 

This included a new agreement which will see, De La Rue, invest $14.4 million to boost its production in Kenya of identity cards, tax stamps and currency, creating new high-skilled jobs locally. He also welcomed the announcement that $68.2 million of UK investment has been raised for a solar power plant, with construction expected to start soon and power to come online in 2020. 

This innovative project, run by British-headquartered power company, Globeleq, and funded by Commonwealth Development Corporation (CDC), the UK’s development finance institution, will bring clean power to the Malindi region in South East Kenya, which currently struggles with regular power shortages and relies largely on expensive thermal plants. 

This is set to transform the local economy, with up to 250 direct jobs being created and a further 5 600 jobs in the wider economy supported thanks to the availability of power. Hunt announced an additional $1.8 million package of support targeted at the creative industries in Kenya and Nigeria. The Creative Enterprise program will help 540 entrepreneurs from across the two countries access training and support in the UK. Hunt said, "I have seen for myself the incredible opportunities opening up between the UK and Kenya and the close partnership which already exists between our countries. 

It is great to see British investment creating jobs, prosperity and growth in Kenya and across the continent". --Africa business communities--
