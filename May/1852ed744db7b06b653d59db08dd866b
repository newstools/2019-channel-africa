Attacks on treatment centres by armed groups and mistrust among residents who view the disease as a conspiracy have become major impediments to containing Democratic Republic of Congo’s worst-ever Ebola outbreak. The haemorrhagic fever has so far killed 1.281 people, according to the latest ministry figures, and shows no signs of slowing its spread, with dozens of new cases a week. The ministry said that on Saturday residents of the village of Vusahiro, in the Mabalako district, “rose up and attacked the local Ebola response team, made up of village residents who were trained to carry out certain response activities”. A hygienist from the infection prevention and control team died of his injuries when he was transferred to hospital, it said. Responders, healthcare workers, and community members are increasingly subjected to threats from armed groups in hotspots such as Katwa and Butembo, the World Health Organization says, complicating efforts to contain Ebola. United Nations officials say that stopping targeted attacks on health workers requires untangling deep-rooted political problems in eastern Congo. --Reuters--
