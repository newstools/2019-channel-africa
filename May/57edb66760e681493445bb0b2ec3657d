So when she heard that a new vaccine was being rolled out against the disease, that across the world kills a child every two minutes, she was one of the first to sign up her baby daughter. The World Health Organisation (WHO) says 219 million people were infected with malaria in 2017, more than 90% of cases occurred in Africa. In Ghana alone, there were 5.5 million confirmed cases of malaria last year, and many more suspected. Six-month-old Blessing, Aguanyi's daughter, has received the first injection, like 360.000 other under two-years-old in Ghana, Malawi and Kenya, the three countries taking part in the landmark vaccine campaign. Children are especially at risk from the deadly mosquito-born disease and babies were Ghana's first vaccine recipients last month in the southern town of Cape Coast, 150 kilometres west of the capital, Accra. Blessing will have three further doses up to the age of two under the programme, which will enable health officials to evaluate the vaccine's effectiveness. Aguanyi said that she would urge other parents to bring their children for the free jab. "Because of money constraints, some wait till their child's situation is critical," Aguanyi said.
