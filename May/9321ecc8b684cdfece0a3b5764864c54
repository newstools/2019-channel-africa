All the 22 924 voting stations are expected to open at 7am and close at 9pm. President Cyril Ramaphosa and his wife Dr Tshepo Motsepe will cast their vote at Hitekani Primary School in Chiawelo, Soweto. 

Ramaphosa had since encouraged eligible voters to participate in these elections, saying their votes will ensure the country’s democracy remains vibrant and inclusive. Meanwhile, the Independent Electoral Commission (IEC) says it’s all systems go for the elections. 

The IEC is urging South Africans to go out in their numbers to cast their ballots. Chief Electoral Officer Sy Mamabolo says those who want to exercise their right to vote must be allowed to do so and should not be disrupted.
