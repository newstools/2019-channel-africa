Strong gains by the Greens at the expense of Germany's two ruling parties in Sunday's European Parliament elections were seen as an indictment of Berlin's policy on climate change. Merkel, in a CNN interview Tuesday, acknowledged that "we have to give better answers" to the planetary challenge. Her conservative CDU/CSU bloc and their leftist junior partners the SPD suffered heavy losses Sunday while the Greens scored over 20%, becoming Germany's second strongest party for the first time. Young voters in particular, energised by the Fridays for Future school strikes, anti-coal protests and blockades, and by a passionate campaign from leading YouTube stars abandoned the mainstream parties in droves. Germany was long seen as a clean energy pioneer, and Merkel dubbed the "climate chancellor", for pushing renewables while committing to phase out nuclear power by 2022 and now coal by 2038. However, green activists now feel that progress has stalled and demand a far earlier end to coal and the combustion engine, as well as dramatic shifts in transport, agriculture and building insulation. Germany is now set to miss its target of cutting CO2 emissions by 40% by 2020 from 1990 levels. It is currently on course for only a 32% reduction. --AFP--
