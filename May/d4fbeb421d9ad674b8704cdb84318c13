Gordhan was Finance Minister at the time. Mkhwebane was speaking in Pretoria where she was releasing a number of investigative reports. Busisiwe Mkhwebane says Ivan Pillay was not entitled to an early retirement pay-out. "Minister Gordhan was not authorised by section 16 2A of the PSA to approve Pillay's early retirement request with full pension benefits as this section does not discuss any power on the minister to approve early retirement with full pension benefits." "Pillay was not entitled to an early retirement with full pension benefits under section 16 2A because the section makes no provision for such full retirement benefits."
