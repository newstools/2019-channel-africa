The food and drinks company, which uses maize in many of its products, said it was unable to counter the shortfall. “The year-on-year regression in the performance of the maize category, off the strong comparative period base, was more than expected, given sustained selling price deflation despite raw material cost inflation and a weaker milling performance,” it said. At 0800 GMT, the company’s share price was down 8.660% to R75.87 ($5.27). Pioneer said continued economic weakness will put pressure on consumer spending. Diluted adjusted headline earnings per share (HEPS) for the six months ended March 31 fell 14% to 272.4 cents from 320 cents a year earlier, the food and beverage company said. HEPS is the main profit measure used in South Africa, which strips out once-off items. Pioneer, which also operates in Britain, said earlier this year that the business was doing well despite Brexit tensions. The food company’s revenue rose 11.5% to R11.039 billion ($768.20 million), driven by growth in bread, wheat, rice, beverages, cereals and sausage rolls in Nigeria. Pioneer issued a dividend of 105 cents per share for the six month ended March 31, 2019. ($1 = R14.37) --Reuters--
