With the injured Nortje back home nursing a dislocated thumb, South Africa were on the receiving end of exactly that philosophy against England at The Oval on Thursday. Jofra Archer, on a wicket that England captain Eoin Morgan said was slightly on the slow side, clocked speeds of above 150 kph. He finished with figures of 3/27 from his seven overs, but he had already gone a long way towards bowling South Africa out of the game in a devastating five-over spell up front. Before he had even taken a wicket, Archer had Proteas stalwart Hashim Amla retired hurt on 5 with a devastating bouncer that went crashing into the 36-year-olds front grille.  It was a sickening blow, and Amla was forced to leave the field with a suspected concussion. Before he returned in the 32nd over, Archer had already bounced out Faf du Plessis and Rassie van der Dussen while he also had Aiden Markram caught at slip. Archer has made his mark at the World Cup immediately, and he will be a handful for all batsmen that come his way. Amla was eventually dismissed for 12 when the Proteas cause was already lost, but he effectively lost his wicket when Archer hit him. Moeen Ali was fielding at fine leg when that incident happened, and speaking after the match he described what he saw. --News24--
