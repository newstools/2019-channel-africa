Equities across the region were hammered Monday, led by Shanghai's worst losses in three years after the president's warning fuelled by frustration at slow progress in the talks. Trump's remarks shocked markets, coming just days after officials on both sides had sounded positive on the talks, with markets broadly expecting an agreement to be announced soon. While some observers pointed out that such high-stakes moves are characteristic of Trump's negotiating style and that they expect a deal to be agreed anyway, OANDA senior market analyst Jeffrey Halley remained cautious. "Say what you want about the US president but predictability and subtlety were never part of his election pledges," he said in a note. "China has most certainly found this out the hard way and likely explains why they are still sending their full delegation to this week's round of trade talks. "I take much greater comfort in China's pragmatism than the president's Twitter account, but the markets should take a leaf from China's playbook and not assume the president was merely bluffing." Asian markets started Tuesday on a healthy note as investors took their lead from Wall Street but the rally began to flag in the early afternoon before China confirmed that Vice Premier Liu He will be part of the talks team this week. While Beijing had said they would send representatives, there were concerns Xi Jinping's point man might not attend.
