“I’m here until the year 2020,” Collymore told reporters on the side-lines of a meeting. He was due to step down in August.  “I kind of owed the company, and the board and I agreed we will stretch that for a year.” Two company sources said late last month that Collymore had planned to step down in August for health reasons, but the government’s insistence he should be succeeded by a Kenyan had delayed the announcement of a replacement. Collymore has helped to build Safaricom into East Africa’s most profitable company, thanks to the popular mobile money transfer service M-Pesa and a growing customer base. Safaricom is 35% owned by South Africa’s Vodacom and controls about 62% of Kenya’s mobile market, with more than 30 million subscribers. Britain’s Vodafone has a 5% stake and the Kenyan government 35%. Safaricom’s core earnings for the financial year that ended in March rose 13.1% to 89.6 billion Shillings ($887 million), driven by growth in its M-Pesa digital financial business.
