Earlier this month, the public prosecutor ordered Bashir to be interrogated on charges of money laundering and financing terrorism. There has been no comment from Bashir since his ousting and arrest on April 11. Bashir, who faces an International Criminal Court arrest warrant from March 2009 for war crimes and crimes against humanity, has dismissed the court’s claims that he is responsible for crimes in the Darfur region leading to the death of as many as 300 000 people and a campaign of “rape, hunger and fear” against a further 2.5 million in refugee camps. --Reuters--
