But Wednesday’s decision by the World Trade Organization (WTO) left Scottish whisky makers, Spanish winemakers and French cheesemakers fuming as the US tariffs targeted products from countries in the Airbus (AIR.PA) consortium. Engineers in Germany worried that the row over subsidies granted to the European planemaker was leading to “a table tennis match” over transatlantic tariffs, and France warned of retaliation by the EU. The WTO decision gave the United States the go-ahead to impose tariffs on $7.5 billion worth of EU goods annually in the long-running case. The dispute darkens the global economic outlook, which already has the cloud of the U.S.-China trade dispute hanging over it. Washington and Beijing have imposed tariffs on each other’s goods worth hundreds of billions of dollars. Trump said on Twitter the EU “has for many years treated the USA very badly on Trade due to Tariffs, Trade Barriers, and more. This case going on for years, a nice victory!”
