Leon Mugesera, who was extradited from Canada in 2012, argued that one of the judges who listened to his previous case "hated him". He denies any involvement role in the genocide. Mugesera was found guilty in 2016 for calling on ethnic Hutus to kill members of the Tutsi ethnic group in a speech in 1992. He came under heavy criticism after the speech and fled to Canada. --BBC--
