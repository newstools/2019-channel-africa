Via a column for The Times, Barnes called on Springbok coach Rassie Erasmus to include Francois Louw in the starting team for the final against England. Louw replaced Kolisi in the 69th minute of last weekend's 19-16 semi-final win over Wales and proved influential when he won a vital penalty on the ground in the 74th minute. The Welsh were hot on the attack at that stage, with the game on a knife edge at 16-all. "South Africa have more chance of winning without their captain. Erasmus, if he can indeed ignore the 'historical and political perspective', should select his captain on the bench," Barnes wrote Louw's familiarity with the English players is given as a reason for punting his inclusion. "The number six shirt should be worn by the South African who knows the game of Sam Underhill, England's key man, better than anyone - his fellow Bath flanker Francois Louw. Kolisi does not only represent black people but everyone in South Africa. The decision should be colour-blind."
