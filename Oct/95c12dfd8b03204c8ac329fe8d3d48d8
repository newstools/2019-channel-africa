Mimi Mefo Takambo, who is based in Germany, said on Twitter that she believed she was denied entry because Australian authorities thought she might attempt to stay in the country. The official rejection latter from Australia's Department Home Affairs reportedly stated that they were "not satisified" that the journalist, who currently works for German broadcaster Deutsche Welle, had an "employment and financial situation that would provide an incentive to return following their stay in Australia or to abide by the conditions to which the visa would be subject". Mefo won the 2019 Index on Censorship's freedom of expression award for journalism. That organisation has criticised the visa decision, as have numerous journalists, Australia's biggest media union MEAA and conference organisers at Griffiths University in Brisbane where she was due to speak. --BBC--
