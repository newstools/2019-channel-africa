The corporation on Tuesday presented its annual report to Parliament, which showed a loss of $33 million. The broadcaster received a $14 million lifeline from on October to keep operating. While most of its income comes from advertising ($31 million) in the year to end March) licence fees could put it in the green if payment levels neared those of its British counterpart. The SABC, which has 18 radio stations, three TV channels and two channels on DStv, has been attempting to up its collection rate to boost revenue. Losses mean it cannot broadcast any of the games at the Rugby World Cup in Japan on television.
