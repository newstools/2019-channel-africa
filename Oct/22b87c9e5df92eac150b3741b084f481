The FTSE/JSE All Share Index (Alsi) fell 0.65 % to 55 572.18 points, while the financial index also slipped. Banking stocks followed suit, with Standard Bank leading the charge, falling 3.50% to R175 ($11.98), while Nedbank was down 1.46% to R240.55 ($16.46). FirstRand closed 0.82% lower at R67.74 ($4.64), and Absa was 0.71% weaker at R162.94 ($11.15). Prosus owns 31% of Tencent, the fourth-largest internet company in the world, after it was spun off from Naspers last month. Lester Davids, a trader at Unum Capital, said yesterday that the market declined largely due to the fall of Naspers, as it had a substantial weighting in the Alsi. Davids said post the unbundling of Naspers, the group holds just more than 70% of Prosus, which holds a stake in Tencent. “This morning in Hong Kong, we saw the Tencent share price come under pressure with no discernible reason for its 2.23% drop. This is the reason why Naspers and the All Share Index are lower for the session,” said Davids. Naspers was unbundled with the listing of Prosus, a move that was seen as marking another key step in the restructuring of the South African internet giant's assets. Michael Treherne, a portfolio manager at Vestact Asset Management, said Tencent had been in a tight spacing after losing 20% on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange in the past six months. Treherne said Tencent had fallen to $320 (R4 694) a share on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange from $400 a share six months ago. “The unrest in Hong Kong has not helped the share, either,” he said. On Tuesday, Prosus made a hostile R93 billion ($6.36 billion) bid for Just Eat, entering into a transaction that could disrupt its merger with Dutch rival Takeaway. Prosus offered R135.75 ($9.29) a share, representing a 20% premium to Just Eat’s closing price on Monday. Yesterday, Aberdeen Standard Investments, which owns a 5.2% stake in Just Eat, said Prosus needed to come up with a significantly higher bid. “We believe Prosus’s current all-cash offer of 710 pence (R134.75) significantly undervalues the group,” investment director Frederik Nassauer said. “In our view, Prosus would need to raise their cash offer by at least 20% in order for it to be deemed attractive.” Mergence Investment Managers money manager Peter Takaendesa said the slump reflected weakness in technology stocks following a warning by US semiconductor maker Texas Instruments that it saw broad-based weakness across most markets and sectors. “There have been a couple of warnings from Texas Instruments about weakness within the technology supply chain,” Takaendesa said. --BusinessReport--
