AFP reports that the president is widely expected to be re-elected, despite his popularity taking a hit from chronic unrest and a financial crisis linked to alleged state corruption. His party Frelimo, which has ruled the southern African nation since independence from Portugal in 1975, is widely expected to again beat its arch-rival Renamo, a former rebel group turned main opposition party. The opposition has already accused Frelimo of tampering with the vote.
