President Macky Sall pardoned his former political rival, who had been sentenced for fraudulent use of public funds, the presidency announced on Sunday. The move surprised many Senegalese, although it comes amid a de-escalation of political tensions orchestrated by Muslim leaders. Sall, no relation to the President, has been in jail since March 2017 and was sentenced to five years in prison in August 2018. He was therefore barred from taking part in the presidential election in February. As the news of the pardon spread, hundreds of his supporters gathered late on Sunday outside the Rebeuss prison in Dakar, from where he emerged a few hours later.Â 

They then accompanied his convoy across several neighbourhoods of the capital, including Grand Yoff, the electoral stronghold of the 63-year-old socialist, AFP journalists said.
