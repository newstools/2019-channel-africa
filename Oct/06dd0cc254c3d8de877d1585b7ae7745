Old Trafford chief Ole Gunnar Solskjaer revealed after Sunday's impressive 3-1 victory over Norwich City at Carrow Road that his talisman midfielder recently suffered a setback to his planned comeback. The Norwegian is clearly taking no risks after he stated: "I don't think we'll see him maybe before December. He'll be out for a while. He needs time to fully, fully recover, so I don't think he'll be back, maybe Sheffield United after the international break but probably December before you can see him. "I'm not the doctor but there is an injury there that needs healing, yes. Ankle rather than foot." Pogba has played just twice in the last 10 games and last featured for the Red Devils against Arsenal on September 30. It is understood the France World Cup winner initially sustained the injury in the 1-1 draw at Southampton a month earlier, choosing to play through the pain barrier in an effort to help United turn around a dodgy sequence of results. Despite Solskjaer's caution, however, 26-year-old Pogba is certainly pulling out all the stops in an effort to rejoin the fight for United.
