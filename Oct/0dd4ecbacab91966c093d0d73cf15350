Shares of Yum fell 5% before the bell, after the Louisville, Kentucky-based company also reported same-store sales below Wall Street estimates. Restaurants are aggressively investing in technology and convenience to pull in more diners who enjoy a multitude of options in terms of ordering, delivery and even preparing food at home with ready-to-cook items. To keep up with the changing trend, Yum bought a stake in GrubHub last year, hoping to boost sales at its KFC and Taco Bell restaurants in the United States. GrubHub executives blamed ‘promiscuous’ diners for slowing growth earlier this week, as customers opted to choose from a growing pool of rival providers to get better deals. The same problems are hurting growth at Pizza Hut, which has been struggling to improve performance as it faces competition from rival pizzeria Domino’s Pizza (DPZ.N).
