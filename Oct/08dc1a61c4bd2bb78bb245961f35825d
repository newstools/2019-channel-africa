Doctors without Borders (MSF), along with SOS Mediterranee, said that among those aboard the ship were two pregnant women and 41 children younger than 18 years old. "Their anxiety is growing," said Jay Berger, MSF's Project Co-ordinator aboard the Ocean Viking. "They're unsure of what's going to happen to them next." On October 18, the Ocean Viking embarked 104 people on an inflatable boat in distress 50 nautical miles off the Libyan coast. Libyan authorities assigned the port of Tripoli as a safe disembarkation site for the refugees, which have been subsequently refuted by SOS Mediterranee. The group contacted Italian and Maltan authorities last week to ask for a disembarkation site, to no avail so far. The migrants coming to Europe in recent years have mainly been fleeing wars and poverty in the Middle East, Asia and Africa. Dozens of migrants have also been killed trying to make the Mediterranean crossing in recent months. Confirmed deaths on the three main Mediterranean Sea migratory routes in the first nine months of the year were 994, figures released by the International Organisation for Migration (IOM) showed. The number is the lowest recorded since 2014. It is not because of an improvement in safety conditions but is linked to the reduction in the number of people attempting to cross, the IOM said. Interior ministers from five European Union (EU) countries, including Italy, said last month they had agreed on a new scheme to distribute migrants saved from the Mediterranean under a deal aimed at relieving the pressure on southern EU states. --Reuters--
