Transnet says the four-kilometre long train, with 375 wagons, will also carry the highest volumes per train. The train will transport manganese over a distance of more than 860 kilometres between the Sishen mine in the Northern Cape and Saldanha Bay , South Africa. Transnet says the train will go a long way in lowering the cost of doing business in the country and migrating traffic from road to rail. It is estimated that the train will add $25 million in freight revenue annually.
