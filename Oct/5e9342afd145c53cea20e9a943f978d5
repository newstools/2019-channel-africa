The 26-year-old striker plays for Portimonense in the top flight of Portuguese football and is in his second season with the club. He is Portuguese-born but of Sao Tomese descent and was asked by Sao Tome coach Eusebio Adriano to join the squad for the two legged tie against Mauritius, which will determine a place in Group C alongside Ghana, South Africa and Sudan. But he turned down the request. Boa Morte is a nephew of ex-Portugal international Luis Boa Morte, now an assistant manager at Everton in the Premier League. The first leg is in Mauritius on Wednesday and the return in Sao Tome on Sunday. Last month Sao Tome lost over two legs to Guinea Bissau in the preliminary round of the 2022 World Cup qualifiers. --AfricaFootball--
