Mohammad bin Salman told CBS program “60 Minutes” that as de facto Saudi leader he ultimately bore “full responsibility” for the killing a year ago, but he denied ordering it. He made similar remarks to US broadcaster PBS. Asked how he did not know about the killing by Saudi officials, he told CBS it was impossible for him to know “what three million people working for the Saudi government do daily”. In an interview with Reuters, Agnes Callamard, UN expert on summary executions, attributed his remarks to a “strategy of rehabilitation in the face of public outrage around the world”. “He is creating a distance between himself, he is exonerating himself from direct criminal responsibility in the killing. He is creating layers, and layers and layers of actors and institutions which are protecting him from his direct accountability for the killing.” She spoke before joining Khashoggi’s family and friends in Istanbul on Wednesday to mark the murder’s first anniversary. Khashoggi, a Washington Post columnist and critic of the crown prince, was murdered on October 2 at its consulate in Istanbul. 

His dismembered body has never been found. A global outcry ensued and led to US Treasury sanctions on 17 Saudi individuals and a Senate resolution blaming Prince Mohammed. Saudi officials have denied suspicions in the CIA that the crown prince, known as MbS, ordered the killing. Eleven people are on trial in Saudi Arabia, although Callmard has voiced concerns over a potential miscarriage of justice.
