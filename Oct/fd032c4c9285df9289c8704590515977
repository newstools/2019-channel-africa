The country's wildlife department said finding the poaching gangs was now its highest priority. Botswana, which until recently had a shoot-to-kill policy for poachers, is home to just under 400 rhinos. Poaching is on the rise in the region, driven by demand for rhino horn in Asian countries where it is used in traditional medicine or as a symbol of wealth and success. Last year more than 700 rhinos were killed in neighbouring South Africa. --BBC--
