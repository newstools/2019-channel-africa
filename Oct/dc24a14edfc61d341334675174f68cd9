Mbwana Ally Samatta's 23 league goals last season helped fire the unfashionable club from an old mining hub in the Dutch-speaking north of Belgium to the league title and a return to Europe's leading club competition. The 26-year-old then became the first Tanzanian to play in the Champions League and marked the occasion by scoring on an otherwise miserable night for Genk as they lost 6-2 in Salzburg in their Group E opener. Since then they have held Napoli to a 0-0 draw at home, a result which gives an unfancied side hope they can spring a surprise against the reigning European champions. "Some people thought it might be very difficult for us against Napoli but we could have won that game so we will see. We will give everything at home," said Genk coach Felice Mazzu at the weekend. Just as Genk have brought through and sold on the likes of Thibaut Courtois, Kevin De Bruyne, Kalidou Koulibaly, Christian Benteke and Wilfred Ndidi in recent years, Divock Origi also spent time here as a youngster, so key members of last season's title-winning side were allowed to leave. However, Samatta stayed despite interest from around Europe, including a reported 10 million-euro ($11.2 million) offer from Dynamo Moscow.
