Coetzee is playing his first Sunshine Tour event for this season and after what’s been a solid season for him in Europe, he wasted no time in showing off his class in Knysna. 

He was three-under after his opening four holes thanks to an eagle on the 12th, which was his third hole and a birdie on the next hole. 

A par on 14 was followed back-to-back birdies and a par later, Coetzee found more joy, making an eagle there to turn in 29. “I enjoyed that,” he said after his round, “it’s not every day you get to play that well and when you do, you still have to finish the round. I would have loved the one (birdie) on eight just to have a chance on that magic number (59) on the ninth; I had one shot at it and I missed the green. Otherwise, it was good fun.” That eagle on the 18th was followed by another pair of consecutive birdies after the turn. He birdied the fourth and the seventh, his 13th and 16th holes of the round. “When you stop trying, that’s when it starts happening,” Coetzee said of his approach to the round. “I’m not complaining that I left anything out there because I definitely picked up a few that I shouldn’t have. I was hitting a lot of fairways. I was busy doing my own stats and I thought ‘ow, I didn’t miss a single fairway on that nine’, that doesn’t happen often. And then I missed two fairways; the one was a bad bounce and the other bounced on the road next to the green but when things are going your way, you just keep calm and enjoy.” He’s certainly enjoyed being back home.
