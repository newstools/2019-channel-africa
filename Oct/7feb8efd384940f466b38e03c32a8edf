Friday October 25 is the day SADC member states dedicated for regional solidarity against the embargo on Zimbabwe, now spanning two decades. Speaking in an interview with Russian News Agency, Sputnik, ahead of the Russia-Africa Summit which opens today, the President praised SADC member states for joining hands with Harare in the fight against the illegal sanctions. He said Africa’s vision was to be united as espoused by the continent’s founding fathers and speak with one voice. “The issue is that Zimbabwe has been under sanctions for two decades. The SADC Summit in August resolved that member states will demonstrate against these illegal sanctions imposed on us by the West so that they can be removed,” said Mnangagwa. Preparations for the day of solidarity against sanctions are gathering pace countrywide, with the main event set for the National Sports Stadium in Harare. Government has since declared Friday a national holiday, apart from examination writing classes, to allow citizens to go out in their numbers and condemn the sanctions. SADC countries have also heightened preparations for the demonstration against the ruinous and illegal sanctions. The President said Zimbabwe’s presence in Russia was not to seek military equipment as has been suggested by some sections of the media. He said Harare only wants to deepen collaboration with Moscow as it seeks to transform its economy, which has suffered immensely under the weight of US sanctions over 20 years. --Herald--
