Labor market strength was reinforced by other data on Thursday showing a sharp drop in layoffs announced by US-based employers in September.   

The lowest unemployment rate in nearly 50 years is supporting consumer spending, keeping the economy on a moderate growth path despite a slump in manufacturing. Initial claims for state unemployment benefits increased 4 000 to a seasonally adjusted 219 000 for the week ended September 28, the Labor Department said. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast claims would increase to 215,000 in the latest week. The Labor Department said no states were estimated last week. Claims have now increased for three straight weeks. Some of the rise in claims could be the result of an ongoing strike by workers at General Motors. While striking workers are not eligible for unemployment benefits, the work stoppage has affected production, impacting non-striking employees at suppliers. 

There was a jump in manufacturing claims in Michigan during the week ended September 21. In a separate report on Thursday, global outplacement firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas said job cuts announced by US-based employers fell 22.3% to a five-month low of 41.557 in September.
