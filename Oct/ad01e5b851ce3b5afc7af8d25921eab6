"What they did in Djibouti is something that is really illegal. In fact they have no right to do that." Sultan Ahmed bin Sulayem was in the Rwandan capital Kigali for the opening of a $35 million logistics platform. But he said his company's ability to start new projects on the African continent has been hampered by what took place in February 2018. That was when, in a dispute dating back years, Djibouti's government seized the Doraleh Container Terminal. DP World, which is controlled by the Dubai government, said that was illegal. In August 2018, the London Court of International Arbitration ruled that DP World's contract was still valid and binding. "Now look at the rating of Djibouti it's very bad. Nobody will put money there. And it reflects on us badly because we're looking at building other ports in Africa”. “The minute you want to borrow money they have an example of a country that have violated their agreement and did not honour it and did it. So what Djibouti did hurt Djibouti and hurt Africa, more than us because we are insured and everything and we'll recover." Sulayem said his company is active in Somalia, Mozambique, Senegal, and Mali and had signed an agreement to develop a port in the Democratic Republic of Congo. It's also hoped the Kigali facility will boost Rwanda's efforts to become a trade hub for neighbouring countries. Rwanda's President Paul Kagame says the facility shows Rwanda is doing its part to connect with a larger market of 1.2 billion consumers in Africa and beyond.  --Reuters--
