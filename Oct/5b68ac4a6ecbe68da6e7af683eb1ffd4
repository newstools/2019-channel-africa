The company, which owns 43.4% of Japanese manufacturer Nissan (7201.T), said Renault group revenue fell 1.6% to $12 billion. It also said the group’s third-quarter sales by volume were down 4.4% to 852.198 vehicles. Renault had already flagged the weaker revenue in a profit warning last week, which sent its shares falling. On Friday it offered explanations for the worse-than-expected numbers. Besides selling Renault-branded vehicles, the company also uses its plants to manufacture vehicles for its partner, Nissan, and for Daimler, and it is a specialist in making diesel engines for other automakers. Sales of the vehicles it makes for partners have slowed, with a knock-on effect on Renault’s revenues, while demand for diesel engines in Europe has declined. Renault said those effects were compounded by the closure of the Iranian market since last year as a result of US trade sanctions.
