Hopes of a breakthrough lifted markets on Tuesday, but investors turned more cautious after looking for a deal during the night that never came. Conflicting reports about the ongoing talks triggered a series of sharp moves on the pound. Reports that Germany might use emergency measures to counter any market panic from a hard Brexit, such as banning bets on falling share prices, also weighed on morale. “Most of the good news that could have been anticipated has been priced in, and now there’s caution it seems on whether we get a deal today or not,” said Kallum Pickering, senior economist at Berenberg. Sterling was GBP=D3 down 0.4% against the dollar with investors trading volatility levels not seen since the 2016 June Brexit referendum. The pound had strengthened by close to 5% over the past week as investors rushed to reprice the prospect of a last-minute Brexit deal before the Oct. 31 deadline. Euro zone government bonds were also volatile on Wednesday as investors watched the eleventh-hour talks. German 10-year government bond yields DE10YT=RR were last flat at -0.42%, after reaching an 11-week high of -0.397% as Bunds extended a sell-off that began on Tuesday. British government 10-year bond yields were down 2.7 basis points at 0.67%, unaffected by data showing inflation in September reached 1.7% year-on-year, below market expectations.
