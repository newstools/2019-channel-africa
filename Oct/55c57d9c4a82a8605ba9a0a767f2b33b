Foreign Affairs and International Trade Minister Sibusiso Moyo said this in an article published in an Australian-based publication, the Spectator, where he was imploring member countries that include Canberra to lend their support to have Harare re-admitted to the 53-member body after it pulled out in 2003. Australia is one of the founding members of the 53 Commonwealth member countries and its former Prime Minister, John Howard, was part of a troika that suspended Zimbabwe before Harare eventually withdrew from the body the following year. The call to have Zimbabwe re-admitted to the Commonwealth followed a meeting between President Mnangagwa and Commonwealth Secretary-General Patricia Scotland last month on the sidelines of the United Nations General Assembly. In his article published yesterday, Minister Moyo said Scotland had correctly observed that Zimbabwe had embarked on major reforms that included repeal and replacement of laws that infringed personal and economic freedoms, a process he said was already underway. He said the reforms had led to a rise in global rankings for freedom of expression and placed Zimbabwe amongst the top 20 improvers in the World Bank’s Doing Business 2020 index. Moyo said Government’s economic reforms were making Zimbabwe once more open for business, coupled by the potential of economic collaboration in the areas of mining, energy and agriculture where Australia is acknowledged as a world leader. --Herald--
