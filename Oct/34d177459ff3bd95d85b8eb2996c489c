Bafana have two Africa Cup of Nations (AFCON) qualifiers scheduled to be played in November, away to Ghana and at home to Sudan. According to SAFA, CAF want Bafana to play Ghana on November 15 away from home and then host Sudan on November 17 and has set the kick-off time to 21:00 on a Sunday night. SAFA though is having none of it and are proposing they play Ghana on Thursday, November 14, before hosting Sudan on Sunday, November 17, but in an afternoon kick-off. In quotes published by the Sowetan, SAFA Acting Chief Executive, Russell Paul, said: "No one will come out to watch at that time of night before a working day. "I've told CAF we can only play on a Sunday afternoon, not evening." Paul also confirmed that the match against Sudan will be played at the Orlando Stadium. "We cannot take the game outside of Gauteng because there is no time to catch any connecting flights after the team comes back from Ghana," Paul said. The first two rounds of group matches begin on Wednesday, November 13 and go through to Tuesday, November 19. Each team is to play two matches in that six day window, one home and one away. There are 12 groups of four countries each in the qualifying competition for Cameroon 2021. The top two finish advance to the 24-team finals. --News24--
