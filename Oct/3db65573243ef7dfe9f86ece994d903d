The claimants said Google, a unit of Alphabet Inc., had illegally accessed details of Apple (AAPL.O) iPhone users’ internet browsing data by bypassing privacy settings on the Safari browser between June 2011 and February 2012. London’s High Court ruled in October 2018 that Google’s alleged role in the collection, collation and use of data from the browser was wrongful and a breach of duty, but claimants had not suffered “damage” as specified by Britain’s Data Protection Act. James Oldnall, lead lawyer on the case, said the Court of Appeal decision had “confirmed our view that representative actions are essential for holding corporate giants to account”. Richard Lloyd, the representative claimant in the mass action, said Wednesday’s judgment “sends a very clear message to Google and other large tech companies: you are not above the law.” “Google can be held to account in this country for misusing people’s personal data, and groups of consumers can together ask the courts for redress when firms profit unlawfully from ‘repeated and widespread’ violations of our data protection rights,” he added.
