The 53 migrants and refuges were killed in the airstrike which was blamed on rebel forces trying to get control of the capital. There was widespread international condemnation of the airstrike, which the UN said may have been a war crime. The World Health Organisation says that at least 1 000 people have been killed, including around 100 civilians, and 120 000 displaced, since fighting began on the outskirts of Tripoli six months ago. Survivors of the airstrike remain trapped in a city under attack, where they have been speaking exclusively to the BBC's international correspondent, Orla Guerin.
