Speaking at the Union Buildings in Pretoria, where he is hosting Buhari on a state visit, Ramaphosa apologised to the Nigerian president for this violence. "We would like to assure you that South Africa is committed to the ideals of African unity and solidarity to respect the human rights of othersâ€¦ "While we are working to address economic and social conditions that has given rise to frustration and anger among some of our people, we firmly condemn all forms of intolerance and will not hesitate to act against criminal acts and violence," he said. The visit marks the 20th anniversary of the Bi-National Commission through which formal relations have been conducted between the two African powerhouses since 1999. Ramaphosa said the visit represented cordial relations between the countries and would strengthen these relations further. "Our meeting today presents us with an opportunity not only to review the general state of our bi-lateral relations, but to make a firm determination [where] the ties between our two countries will be strengthened by your visit here."
