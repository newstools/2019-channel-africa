The batsman had been banned for 20 years by national body Cricket South Africa (CSA) for his role in attempting to fix or influence matches in a 2105 domestic T20 competition. CSA said no fixtures were affected as the plans of Bodi and other would-be conspirators were foiled. Bodi handed himself over to the police last year and was sentenced by a commercial crimes court in Pretoria after multiple postponements. He will appeal the sentence and seek an extension of his R3000 bail. Alviro Petersen, one of the players who Bodi is believed to have approached, was present at the sentencing hearing on Friday.
