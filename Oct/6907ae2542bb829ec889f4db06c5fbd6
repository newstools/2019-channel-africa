They should expect a common refrain during the company conference call: it’s deja vu all over again. Late this summer Texas announced it was leading a group of 48 state attorneys general to probe allegations of anticompetitive practices by Google, largely around its lucrative online advertising business. Google maintains that the same players were involved in similar investigations, but to no avail. And the Federal Trade Commission settled its own two-year antitrust probe in 2013, concluding it has not manipulated search results to hurt rivals “We have answered many questions on these issues over many years, in the United States as well as overseas, across many aspects of our business, so this is not new for us,” Google said in a recent blog post on the topic. That is not stopping states from taking advantage of new political momentum from both sides of the aisle to go after Silicon Valley’s giants, including Google. Missouri, for instance, is folding its two-year old investigation into the new Texas-led probe.
