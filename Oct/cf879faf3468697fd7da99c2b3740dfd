The 34-year-old shot-stopper is a mainstay in Uganda's national side and was first made captain when Milutin Sredojevic was in charge. Onyango continued to lead his country under Sebastian Desabre as the Cranes made the last 16 of African Cup of Nations. Northern Irishman, McKinstry, has now taken charge of Uganda and said Onyango will continue to lead the Cranes as he is a senior figure in the dressing room.

McKinstry told BBC Football: "Denis as a footballer, his career, he is second to none. "He has had an excellent career and he has justly gotten his rewards for that in terms of trophies and personal acknowledgments.

"He has obviously been the captain for the Cranes for a while now and down at Mamelodi Sundowns. He is a leading light in the dressing room so I think that there is a lot more that Denis has to offer. "I very much want him to be part of the success we achieve going forward."
