Nissan’s profits have nearly evaporated and its business has weakened globally but especially in the United States.   

“Nissan is on the right path for recovery, although it might be a gradual process,” Uchida, who is Nissan’s China chief, said in a video message posted on an internal company website. Someone who saw the video made details of it available to Reuters. Uchida is expected to formally take up the CEO post by January 1. 2020. His appointment was announced in early October, along with decisions by the board of Japan’s second-biggest automaker (7201.T) to name Mitsubishi Motors (7211.T) executive Ashwani Gupta chief operating officer and Nissan executive Jun Seki vice chief operating officer. The three will take the helm of a company that has been shaken by turmoil following the downfall of former chairman Carlos Ghosn last year and the departure of former CEO Hiroto Saikawa in September. To restore profitability, the Yokohama-based automaker is in the process of laying off some 12 500 employees globally and is trying to mend frayed ties with its alliance partner, Renault SA (RENA.PA).
