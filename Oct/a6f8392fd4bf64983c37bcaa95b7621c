The Pixelbook Go, starting at $649, features a textured bottom panel, meant to make it easier to grip with one hand while working in transit, Google’s hardware design chief Ivy Ross said at the announcement at a New York art studio. Google’s efforts to develop its own hardware have generated mixed results since becoming a priority for the search company four years ago. Its smart speakers and Wifi routers are popular in several countries, but its smartphones and laptops have gained little traction versus industry leaders such as Samsung Electronics Co (005930.KS) and Apple Inc (AAPL.O). The new 13.3-inch (33.8 cm) touchscreen laptop follows the Pixelbook, which debuted in 2017 with a starting price of $999 but has barely made a dent on the market, to the point that some market researchers do not track it. Google slashed costs for Pixelbook Go by shifting to magnesium from aluminum for the laptop exterior and removing hinges and wiring that enabled the prior model to be used like a tablet, product leaders Ben Janofsky and Matt Vokoun said in an interview.
