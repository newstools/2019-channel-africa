Bank of America (BAC.N) rose 2.2% after beating analysts’ estimates for third-quarter profit as the second-largest U.S. bank by assets earned more in advisory fees and grew its loan book. PNC Financial Services Group Inc (PNC.N) and Bank of New York Mellon Corp (BK.N) also rose after better-than-expected earnings. The reports followed robust results on Tuesday from JPMorgan Chase & Co (JPM.N) and Citigroup Inc (C.N), showing consumer confidence remained strong despite recession fears that have led businesses to pull back on spending and borrowing. “We had a pretty good celebration yesterday after the first busy day of earnings and we got another busy day today, so I think that the path of least resistance is a little bit lower today,” said Art Hogan, chief market strategist at National Securities in New York. The S&P 500 bank sector .SPXBK gained 0.4% after hitting a one-year high on Tuesday.
