The Archbishop of York, John Sentamu, who is leading a commission investigating the impact of multinational oil companies in Nigeria's southern Bayelsa state, said the poor condition of facilities would not be tolerated anywhere else, and the companies were ultimately responsible for any spills from their installations. Sentamu also accused the Nigerian government of abdicating its responsibility to protect Bayelsa's diverse ecosystem.
