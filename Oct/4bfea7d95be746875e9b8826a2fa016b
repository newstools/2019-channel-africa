Kirsten was reportedly in London this week for an interview with the England & Wales Cricket Board (ECB). According to the Daily Mail, Kirsten is in the running alongside fellow countryman Graham Ford and England's Chris Silverwood. Kirsten could be Trevor Bayliss' successor, who left after four years in charge of the England Lions. The South African boasts an impressive coaching resume, having coached India to the 2011 Cricket World Cup title and managed the Proteas for two years from 2011-2013. The 51-year-old is currently the head coach of the Mzansi Super League franchise, the Durban Heat and the Cardiff-based team for England's The Hundred competition. Atherton stated that the former South African batsman would be a perfect candidate. "No English coach has such an impressive CV as Kirsten's," Atherton wrote in the Times newspaper, as quoted by Reuters. If appointed, Kirsten would be England's fourth foreign coach joining the likes of Zimbabweans Duncan Flecther and Andy Flower and Australian Bayliss. "He (Kirsten) would make a fine choice. There are those who will frown upon another overseas appointment... I'm not of that number," wrote Atherton. "The captain, Joe Root, (is) in need of a coach to apply greater structure than the free-wheeling Bayliss was apt to do. South Africans love a bit of structure." England begin their tour of New Zealand later this month, playing five Twenty20s and two Tests in November. England are also scheduled to tour South Africa in the summer starting with the Boxing Day Test at Centurion.
