The government, closely allied to centrist President Emmanuel Macron, is walking a political tightrope because it is under pressure too from its own supporters who opposed any measures they view as pandering to the far-right. Setting out the government’s position in a parliamentary hearing on immigration, Philippe said it was important to act with humanity toward migrants. But he said: “The question of being steered by targets for admissions for residency is not a taboo. I’m not afraid of thinking about the idea of quotas.” Philippe also said there would be a review of the system for providing free medical care to immigrants who do not have official status in France, a system that critics say is open to exploitation by illegal migrants. “France should take care of all those who live on its territory. But it should be neither more, nor less, attractive than its neighbors,” he said. France last year recorded 123,000 asylum requests, an increase of 22% on the previous year. Macron’s government, while trying to navigate a middle course on immigration, has come under fire from both right and left. Speaking last week, Marine Le Pen, leader of the far-right National Rally, said the government was undermining national security by letting people with violent Islamist tendencies into the country. “The government worsens a deadly danger every day, with its senseless immigration policy. The state is absent, dramatically absent, criminally absent.” In the debate on Monday, Jean-Luc Melenchon, leader of the leftist France Unbowed party, said in remarks directed at the government: “You want to make the immigrant, once again, into a scapegoat, rather than the financier who pillages our wealth through fraud and tax evasion.”
