"If you look the overall performance of the team, they showed commitment, a lot of confidence when they were in possession and they defended well," Jordaan said. "I think credit must also go to Mali, they have a very good team. "They have very good individual players, they had the structure but I think we had the upper hand in the general performance of the game itself." This was Ntseki’s first assignment in charge of the South African Senior Men’s National Team, which Jordaan described as the dawn of a new era. Dean Furman and substitute Themba Zwane grabbed the goals for Bafana Bafana in front of a crowd of just over 18-thousand fans. Next month, South Africa takes on Ghana and Sudan at the start of the Cameroon 2021 Africa Cup of Nations qualifiers. Meanwhile, Sao Tome e Principe has joined Bafana Bafana in Group C.
