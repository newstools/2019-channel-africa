Kick-off is at 11:00 (South African time).Â 

Garces will be assisted by England's Wayne Barnes and New Zealand's Ben O'Keeffe, with another Kiwi, Ben Skeen, the television match official (TMO).

Garces was the referee when the Springboks lost 23-13 to New Zealand earlier in the tournament. The Boks have a torrid record under his watch, winning a meagre four of the 14 Tests he's officiated for a 29% win-record. They've lost all six times he's refereed a Test against New Zealand and was also the referee when they famously lost to Japan at the 2015 World Cup in Brighton. In the other semi-final between New Zealand and England in Yokohama on Saturday (10:00 SA time), Welshman Nigel Owens will be the referee. Owens will be assisted by French duo Romain Poite and Pascal Gauzere, with South Africa's Marius Jonker as TMO.
