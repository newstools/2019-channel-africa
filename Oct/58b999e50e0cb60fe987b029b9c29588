Nearly one million voters will be choosing members of the national assembly and local authorities. The government has declared public holidays from Wednesday up to Friday. The governing Botswana Democratic Party (BDP), which has been in power since independence in 1966, faces a tough challenge from an opposition coalition led by lawyer Duma Boko. The outcome of the parliamentary vote will determine who becomes president. Former President, Ian Khama, is backing the opposition after falling out with his hand-picked successor, Mokgweetsi Masisi. --BBC--
