CMS has more than 70 offices in 30 countries, and the CMS RM Partners office will be based in Sandton. In addition to its expansion to South Africa, the firm also recently opened up a new office in Iran. During his visit to South Africa this week, Duncan Weston, managing partner of CMS, told Fin24 that CMS is seeing major opportunities for growth in Africa. That is why it has joined forces with local law firm, RM Partners, to represent them in South Africa. "There is a globalisation of law firms taking place. A new breed of global elite law firm has started popping up over the last ten years. That does not, however, mean that smaller local niche firms cannot remain strong too," says Weston. "We are very enthusiastic about the African region. There is a huge lobby from the UK now for investment in Africa." He believes it is best to have a global approach, but along with deep local knowledge as well. "As we look to grow more in Africa, we realise there are huge differences across African countries. That is why I am excited about our young and diverse team in South Africa," he says. "I think strength lies in a number of countries in a region being aligned. That in turn creates a lot of (legal) work between countries." CMS is in the process of aligning with about six law firms across Africa, including Kenya and South Africa. Another important aspect for Weston is the use of technology in the corporate law field. --News24--
