The subpoenas will be issued over the next couple of days, the lawyers separately told Reuters. The lawyers want to know what Boeing Co (BA.N) promised potential airline customers about flight crew training and the 737 MAX certification process, and its communications with the two airlines following a Lion Air crash in Indonesia on Oct. 29, 2018, and before the Ethiopian Airlines crash on March 10. They are seeking documents about 737 MAX software known as MCAS widely linked to both deadly crashes, as well as information on the aircraft’s sensors. The two crashes, both involving 737 MAX jets, killed 346 people and spurred more than 100 lawsuits against the Chicago-based planemaker.
