Kriel had been struggle with a minor hamstring injury that forced him out of selection for the Namibia clash and after consideration was finally ruled out of the squad entirely. Damian Willemse who had been on a short term loan to Saracens in England after the Currie Cup season will link up with the squad as cover in the backline. Willemse’s inclusion bodes well for the Springboks as he can cover flyhalf, Center and Full back. 

His last international test that he starting for the Springboks was when the Boks narrowly went down to England in Twickenham at the end of year tour. Willemse had been also hit with injuries in the 2019 Super Rugby campaign which was one of the main reasons as to why he missed out on the trip initially to Japan. The Springboks will take on Italy in an important group B encounter on Friday.
