The President says the country has chosen to act and undertake the painstaking work to restore South Africa's economy on a path of growth.

" He said in reference to the MTBPS delivered by Finance Minister Tito Mboweni on Wednesday. "SA is facing huge challenges. We need to change the structure of our economy. For 300 years it has just been structured to look after the interests of a minority. If you look at the policies that we have adopted, you will see efforts have been made to reposition the economy," said Ramaphosa. He pointed out that tax collection has decreased and "left a hole". He expressed the hope that labour will understand the situation. "I realise the cost of living in our country is too high and it has an overbearing effect, especially on poor people. Hopefully in about two or three years we will be able to collect more tax," said Ramaphosa. At the same time, Eskom needs to be funded. Â
