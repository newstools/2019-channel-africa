The university has launched an investigation into Prof Raynsford Gyampo and Dr Paul Kwame Butakor after they were secretly filmed propositioning undercover reporters. Both academics have denied the allegations. "The two will be invited by the anti-sexual harassment committee in the next few days to assist with further investigations into the BBC documentary," Stella Amoa, the university's director public affairs, said in a statement on Tuesday. On Monday a lecturer at the University of Lagos in Nigeria, Boniface Igbehnehgu, was suspended after he was filmed offering higher grades to a woman student in return for sex. --BBC--
