Several organisations want Chihombori-Quao, who has Zimbabwean roots, to be reinstated, as they believed she had been sacked because of her pan-African views and her “outspokenness and strong views against France’s occupation and hold over its former African colonies”. The AU Commission has, on the other hand, maintained that the diplomat was relieved of her position in line with the commission’s rules where her political appointment had “come to an end”. Organisations sympathetic to the US-trained doctor have since launched petitions and calls for her to be reinstated. African Diaspora Congress, one of the organisations that have petitioned the AU demanding her reinstatement, said the diplomat was fired because of “influence and pressure exerted on African leaders and people by the former colonial powers of Europe”. The group’s secretary, Apollos Nwauwa, said some leaders were not happy with Chihombori-Quao’s “bold but honest” stance on pan-African issues. The petition that has trended on online has since garnered more than 37 000 signatures. In a recent tweet, AU Chair President, Moussa Faki Mahamat, indicated that he has received the new AU Ambassador to the US. --Herald--
