The increase was attributed to efficiency at the Mombasa Container Terminal Two (CT2), made possible by the automation of container handling processes and improvements in documentation and clearance processes. The special transhipment berth is located at CT2, and was built at a cost of  $270 million. In the eight months to August, the port of Mombasa handled 22.8 million tones up from 20.7 million tones in 2018; transhipment increased by more than 131.9%, from 698 705 last year to 1 619.960 this year. On cumulative container traffic, a significant increase of 22 057 twenty-foot equivalent units (TEUs) or 9.5% was realised during the period of July-August 2019/20 compared with the same period 2018/19 with transshipment traffic mainly accounting for the good performance growing by 30 933 TEUs, which is a 214.6% growth. This is the highest transhipment the port has recorded, and is expected to boost earnings according to head of container operations Edward Opiyo. --TheEastAfrican--
