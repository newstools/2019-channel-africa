Finance Minister Abdirahman Duale Beileh said he was heartened by progress made during discussions with officials from the United States, Somalia’s biggest creditor, Britain, and others during the International Monetary Fund (IMF)/World Bank annual meetings this past week. “Things are looking up. Everybody was positive,” Beileh told Reuters in an interview. He said US and other officials were pleased with Somalia’s strong performance in hitting key benchmarks in a program to work toward debt forgiveness. International Monetary Fund Managing Director, Kristalina Georgieva, on Saturday pledged the IMF’s full support for Somalia’s push for debt relief in the “near future.” The African nation has about $4.7 billion in external debt, which the IMF has declared to be unsustainable. The Fund is analyzing the exact grants needed from members to address Somalia’s debt arrears ahead of a board meeting in mid-November, Beileh said. Britain, the European Union and Qatar had offered to cover about $150 million of the roughly $330 million that Somalia owes the IMF, he said.
