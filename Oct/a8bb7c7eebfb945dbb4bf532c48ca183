That man, of course, was Victor Matfield, now wearing a punditry hat for SuperSport during the 2019 event, and one of the famous “casualties” of that sunny day in Brighton in 2015 when Japan stunned the Boks 34-32. But when the Springboks meet the Brave Blossoms again on the premier global tournament stage, in Sunday’s Tokyo quarter-final (12:15 SA time), Japan will have a “Matfield” of their own … and almost in a carbon-copy situation. Luke Thompson is the oldest customer at this World Cup, aged 38, also a second-rower and similarly playing his fourth (and swansong) one. Born in Christchurch on April 16, 1981, he narrowly saw off in the age “race” - by exactly one month - another Springbok player, Schalk Brits, who entered the world (perhaps even with that trademark grin already?) on May 16 that year. And just as Japanese fans would have been basking in yeoman rugby servant Matfield’s relative misery after the Community Stadium debacle, so Springbok ones will be fervently hoping Thompson – almost certain to be in the underdogs’ line-up this weekend - is instead on the wrong side of the result this time. Thompson had been at the heart of the Japanese engine room in Brighton, paired with Hitoshi Ono (now 41 and long retired) in the second row against a Springbok starting alliance of Matfield and Lood de Jager. This time, he is likely to have Australian-born James Moore as his ally - they were the duo in the pivotal 28-21 pool triumph over Scotland last Sunday - and smart money will be on De Jager and Eben Etzebeth being their Bok foes.
