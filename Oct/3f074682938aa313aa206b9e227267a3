Petaia was named on the left wing for his first Wallabies appearance on Saturday, after injury wrecked his Super Rugby season with the Queensland Reds and delayed his international debut. The Wallabies are coming off a stinging 29-25 defeat by Wales which left them odds-on to finish runners-up to the Six Nations champions in Pool D. Matt To'omua, who starred at fly-half as a replacement against Wales, will earn his 50th cap as he shifts to inside centre in partnership with Tevita Kuridrani. Nic White and Christian Lealiifano were preferred as Australia's ever-evolving half-back combination, while Dane Haylett-Petty shifts to the right wing and Kurtley Beale starts at fullback. Captain Michael Hooper is one of only two players retained in the pack along with Allan Alaalatoa. --Sport24--
