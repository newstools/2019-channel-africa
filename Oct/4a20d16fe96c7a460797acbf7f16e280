According to a poll by the Sigma polling institute, around 90 % of voters aged between 18 and 25 voted for political newcomer Mr Saied, massively shunning his rival, business tycoon Nabil Karoui. In contrast, the institute said 49.2 % of voters aged more than 60 voted for the winner. Under Tunisian law, the results can be appealed within two weeks before the new president is sworn in at the end of the month. Saied, a 61-year-old constitutional law expert, campaigned on a platform of opposition to Westernised and corrupt elites and in favour of radical decentralisation. Tunisia's second free presidential election since the Arab Spring in 2011 followed President Beji Caid Essebsi's death in July. However, he had said he would not run for a second term. In his first reaction as exit polls showed he was the clear victor, Saied thanked the country's young people "for turning a new page" and vowed to try to build "a new Tunisia". Despite having spearheaded the Arab Spring revolt that ousted dictator Zine El Abidine Ben Ali in 2011, young people had largely shunned the ballot box in previous elections in Tunisia's new democracy. --TheEastAfrican--
