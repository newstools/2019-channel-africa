Across Tripoli, tonnes of waste overflows from bins and piles up on roadsides.

"Each weekend I collect the rubbish from my four brothers at the farm where we live and I look for somewhere to dump it. I have no choice but to leave it here on the footpath," he said. The rubbish crisis adds to the daily ordeal for residents of the capital, where life is already punctuated by shortages of fuel, electricity and water. Fed up with the smell and the sight of rats and stray cats feasting in the garbage, some residents have taken to burning the rubbish. But this only replaces the stench of rotting garbage with columns of nauseating smoke in the streets of the capital. Tripoli's trash turmoil isn't a new phenomenon but it has reached alarming proportions in recent months. Municipal rubbish trucks no longer collect waste because the city's main landfill is on a frontline. The dump is at Sidi al-Sayeh, 45km south of Tripoli, where forces loyal to the capital's UN-recognised Government of National Accord (GNA) are battling those of eastern strongman Khalifa Haftar, who launched an offensive on April 4 to seize the city.
