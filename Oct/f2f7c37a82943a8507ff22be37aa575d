The day's play lasted just 12 balls and the triumph emphatically rammed home India's feat in beating Australia's record of 10 straight home series wins and consolidated their place at the top of the World Test Championship. For South Africa, who lost two of the three matches by more than an innings, it was one of their worst series in decades. Nadeem got substitute Theunis de Bruyn caught behind for 30 and then Lungi Ngidi for nought to dismiss the tourists for 133 while following on in the fourth day in Ranchi. India made 497 for nine declared in their first innings. They made South Africa follow on after bowling them out for 162 in their first attempt. The series saw Indian batsmen Mayank Agarwal (215), Virat Kohli (254 not out) and Rohit Sharma (212) all hit double tons against South Africa. But coach Ravi Shastri said the bowlers had played an equally important part. "We always wanted to take 20 wickets irrespective of where we were playing. Our batting is pretty much like a Ferrari taking off," said Shastri after the win.
