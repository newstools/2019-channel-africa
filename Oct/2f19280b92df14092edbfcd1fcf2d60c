He briefed parliament's standing committees on finance and appropriations, as well as their select committees, on the medium term budget policy statement. Mboweni told them that massive aircraft equipment had been disappearing from SAAT – a subsidiary of SAA - which has been set up to service aircraft. "I was told a story by the CEO of SAA [Zuks Ramasia] which boggles the mind. She says a whole spare engine disappeared from SAA Technical. This big thing, how did it leave the airport? It boggles the mind … This is stuff of the movies, man," Mboweni said. "An aircraft part was lost for ideological reasons'. The ideology of what? The ideology of theft under the guise of Marxism,"Mboweni said, before being called to order by MPs. Last week, some SAA, Kulula and British Airways planes were grounded after an inspection conducted by the SA Civil Aviation Authority (SACAA) at SAAT. According to Transport Minister Fikile Mbalula, one of the reasons that SACAA conducted the audit at SAAT was to inspect the loss and theft of aircraft parts, amid reports of an organised crime syndicate that is operating at the organisation. Mbalula said the grounding was a precautionary measure taken by airlines to ensure the safety of passengers.
