The European Medicines Agency (EMA) said bit.ly/2MrRw4c its human medicines committee (CHMP) has recommended granting conditional marketing authorization in the European Union for the vaccine to be branded as Ervebo for individuals 18 and older and at risk of contacting the Zaire Ebola virus. Final approval depends on the European Commission, which generally follows recommendations from the CHMP. The World Health Organisation (WHO) welcomed the decision, saying it will move toward prequalification of the vaccine. WHO’s prequalification program is a service that helps provide access to medicines for severe diseases such as HIV/AIDS and malaria. “The conditional authorization of the world’s first Ebola vaccine is a triumph for public health, and a testimony to the unprecedented collaboration between scores of experts worldwide,” Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, WHO Director-General, said in a statement. The hemorrhagic fever, first discovered in Congo in 1976, spreads through direct contact with body fluids and typically kills roughly half of those it infects.
