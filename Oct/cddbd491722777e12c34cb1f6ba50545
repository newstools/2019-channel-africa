While 47% of South Africans do not report housebreaking, home robbery and deliberate damage to property or arson to the police. Statistics South Africa released these statistics in the Victims of Crime 2018/19 report in Pretoria on Thursday. The report is extracted from the Governance, Public Safety and Justice Survey (GPSJS), which replaced the Victims of Crime Survey. The Victim of Crime Survey is based on interviews with South Africans about their personal experiences and is not based on the number of dockets like the police’s crime statistics, which was released earlier in 2019. The Statistician-General, Risenga Maluleke, says the survey shows almost half of crimes are not reported. “At this point, we get a better understanding of what happens when a crime incident occurs and people are victimised because of crime and they choose to report or not. Because in the event where they would have reported, you would have the incidents not being different all together, but here we have spoken directly to the victims and this is what the victims are saying.” He says theft of personal property, street robbery and assault increased, although only 40% of these crimes were reported to the police. “About a million people aged 16 and up experience theft of personal property, in 2018/19 and this was about 2.54% of the population of persons 16 and older. Theft of personal property accounted for 2.54%, Street robbery for 1% and assault 0.7%.” The survey indicated that almost 50% of assaults were committed to someone close to the victim. 22% were assaulted by a friend or acquaintance, 15% by a spouse or partner and 13% by a relative or other household member. Maluleke says the reporting of sexual offences increased drastically.
