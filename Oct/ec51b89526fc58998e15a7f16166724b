There are, however, no signs of any imminent repatriation. “But the Tanzania government have told us that one day we will wake up and find buses waiting to take us,” one of the refugees told BBC. Tanzania Home Affairs Minister Kangi Lugola said in August that the exercise would take place “whether the refugees want it or not”. The refugees, who have been settled in three camps in south-western Tanzania, have expressed fears they will be returned to Burundi despite their opposition. Some of them say their lives will be in danger if they are forced to return. United Nations (UN) refugee agency's Regional Spokesperson, Dana Hughes, said the agency had asked the Tanzanian and Burundian governments not to repatriate the refugees against their will. A recent UN report said there had been “serious human rights violations” against opposition members in Burundi ahead of general elections in 2020. Burundi is keen to show the international community that is has overcome the effects of the 2015 crisis that was sparked by President Pierre Nkurunziza's push for a controversial third-term in office. --BBC--
