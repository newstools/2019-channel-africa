The South African delighted the home crowds with his eighth European Tour victory two years ago, finishing one stroke ahead of Scott Jamieson, and will be seeking a fourth victory on home soil this November. Set to tee it up in Africa's Major for the sixth time, Grace can't wait to return home to play golf. "Sun City and Gary Player Country Club is such an iconic venue for South African golfers," said Grace, who became the first native golfer to win the Nedbank Golf Challenge since Trevor Immelman 10 years prior. "This is an event steeped in history, and to win two years ago was very special. "I have a lot of happy memories from playing there - it's a demanding, but fair test. The work the team did in constructing and maintaining the golf course all those years ago is astonishing and it is certainly one of the best courses we play all year. I can't wait to play in front of a home crowd again and I'm hoping for another good week as we celebrate the venue's 40th anniversary." Grace joins compatriot and Major winner Louis Oosthuizen in a field which also includes Europe's 2020 Ryder Cup captain Padraig Harrington and Ryder Cup stars Tommy Fleetwood and Lee Westwood, who returns to defend his first Rolex Series title.
