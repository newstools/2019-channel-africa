Earlier in October, Volkswagen established a subsidiary in Turkey’s western Manisa province, while the company said that it was still in the final stages of negotiation and that it had not made a final decision on the factory. 

“We are carefully monitoring the current situation and look with concern at current developments,” a company spokesman said on Tuesday. Volkswagen supervisory board member Stephan Weil, prime minister in Lower Saxony where the carmaker is based, said that he could not imagine that Volkswagen will make an investment given the current circumstances. Lower Saxony is an influential voice at the carmaker with a 20% shareholding. “I have the impression that my view is shared by several other people in the supervisory board,” Weil said, adding that topic would to be discussed at the next meeting of the supervisory board in mid-November. “I very much hope that we will get back to a situation where the Turkish President realizes that he has embarked on a very dangerous path, and the direction must be changed urgently,” he said.
