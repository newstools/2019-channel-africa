Following up on the implementation of retired Judge Ralph Zulman’s report which was released earlier this year by Mthethwa’s predecessor Tokozile Xasa, the new Minister says it’s important that some processes like the elective congress of SASCOC, which was supposed to be next year in November, are brought forward. SABC Sport understands that elections could be held in March next year, just a month before the merger of the Department of Sport and Arts and Culture is finalised. It will also a be a month before the new government financial year kicks in and that will be critical for a SASCOC that is looking at preparing athletes for Olympics in Tokyo, Japan. Speaking after his meeting with the SASCOC board in Fourways on Monday, Mthethwa said there’s a new compliance team.
