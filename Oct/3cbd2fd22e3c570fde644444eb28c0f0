US prosecutors on Tuesday charged Halkbank with taking part in a multi-billion-dollar scheme to evade US sanctions on Iran. Halkbank said the US charges against it amounted to an escalation of Washington’s sanctions on Ankara over its military incursion in Syria, while President Tayyip Erdogan called them an “unlawful, ugly” step. Earlier in October US Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said that President Donald Trump had authorized US officials to draft “very significant” new sanctions to target Turkey after it launched an offensive in northeast Syria, adding that banks were being notified.
