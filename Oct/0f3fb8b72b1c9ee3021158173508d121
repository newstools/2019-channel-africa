There were positives that came out of last year's inaugural tournament, with most of the players and coaches involved hailing the standard of the cricket on offer. The absence of a lucrative broadcast deal and title sponsors as well as modest crowd figures, however, were some of the concerns to have emerged from the 2018 product. Since then, South African cricket has been in the spotlight for all of the wrong reasons. A dismal 2019 World Cup campaign led to radical structural change at Cricket South Africa (CSA) and while there is uncertainty over who will guide the national side forward and how, the real worry in the local game remains rooted in the fact that CSA finds itself in hundreds of millions of Rands in debt. The MSL is supposed to be one vehicle of helping CSA generate the funds to get out of that financial predicament. Broadcasters SuperSport are once again uninvolved for what has been dubbed MSL 2.0, while the tournament will be screened free-to-air on SABC for the second year running. CSA will be holding its breath and hoping that this year's tournament sparks interest from the local cricketing community, and if the words of Steyn and Duminy are anything to go by, then there is hope yet. Both players were members of the Proteas' World Cup squad, though an out-of-form Duminy played a limited role while Steyn did not feature because of injury
