Kolisi was, after all, among the substitutes when the Boks were stunned by Japan in their opening pool match of the 2015 World Cup in Brighton. It remains one of the greatest upsets rugby has ever seen, and it started a Japanese revolution that has seen this year's host nation qualify for their first-ever World Cup quarter-final. Speaking to media on Friday, Kolisi acknowledged that the 2015 defeat to Japan had been difficult to take for the Boks back then. "That was very tough to lose that match in England. That stuck with us until that game when we got here (before this World Cup)," the skipper said. "Itâ€™s something that we never want to go through again." Kolisi was referring to the warm-up match the sides played ahead of the 2019 showpiece, with the Boks running out 41-7 winners there. "But they are a much better team now, and it was good to play that game before the World Cup, just to get that monkey off our back," he said.
