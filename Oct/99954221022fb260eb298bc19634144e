Cell C, South Africa's third-biggest mobile operator is grappling with an R9 billion debt and has lost market share to its peers MTN and Vodacom. Cell C’s 2011 tower agreements and other risk-based pricing on certain contracts have created significant financial drag on the business. Cell C confirmed earlier this month that it was in discussions with MTN regarding an extended roaming agreement which was mutually beneficial to both parties. “We will not comment further as discussions are still in progress,” Cell C said. MTN also confirmed the talks and said an extended roaming agreement was at an advanced stage. “We are currently in discussions with Cell C regarding a revised agreement and how MTN can continue to work with Cell C. We believe there are still opportunities to pursue, to the benefit of both businesses," an MTN spokesperson said. Existing Cell C Board member, Joe Mthimunye will take over as non-executive chairperson effective 20 November 2019. Following his two-year term, outgoing Chairperson, Kuben Pillay, has agreed to remain in the position until a handover process has been concluded. Cell C said in a statement, "The Board would like to thank Pillay for his strong and ethical leadership which has strengthened governance within Cell C.  He was instrumental in building sound relationships with Cell C’s key stakeholders."  --IOL--
