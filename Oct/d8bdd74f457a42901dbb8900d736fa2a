Fastjet is also facing competition from Ethiopian Airlines, whose subsidiary, Ethiopian Mozambique Airlines, is now operating flights on several of the countryâ€™s main domestic routes.

In a statement Fastjet said that the competition in Mozambique began to intensify at the end of 2018 when Ethiopian Airlines entered the domestic market.

It said the competition has led to a fall in its revenue from its Mozambique operations in the first half of 2019 from $4.9 million a year ago to $1.9 million. Mark Hurst, Fastjet interim chief executive officer, said suspending services in Mozambique was the right course of action.
