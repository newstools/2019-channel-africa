Zambia celebrates October 24 as an annual public holiday to mark the country’s independence from British colonial rule. But Lungu also declared Friday a holiday “to give citizens enough time to reflect on our duties and obligations as citizens of this great nation”.

With businesses hit by power cuts that last up to 15 hours a day, Zambians on Twitter have been critical of Lungu’s decision.

--BBC-- As we prepare to celebrate our 55th Independence Anniversary on 24th Oct, this year, I have declared Friday 25th Oct a public holiday to give citizens enough time to reflect on our duties and obligations as citizens of this great nation. ð¿ð² pic.twitter.com/uZKayE2JL5
