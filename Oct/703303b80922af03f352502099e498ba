Victoire Ingabire was questioned on Tuesday and Wednesday and will continue to be questioned on Friday. She denied that she had any connection to the attacks in Musanze district, a tourist area famous for its mountain gorillas. â€œI am on a political battle, not of bullets," Ingabire told BBC Great Lakes on Tuesday, Some of the captured attackers apparently told the authorities that they were members of the Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Rwanda (FDLR) rebel group, which carries out cross-border attacks from their base in neighbouring Democratic Republic of Congo. No group has, however, said it was responsible for last week's attack. Ingabire is the leader of FDU-Inkingi, an opposition party not yet registered in Rwanda. A strong critic of President Kagame, she served eight years of a 15-years prison sentence on charges of threatening national security and denial of the 1994 genocide. She was released last year after a presidential pardon. Ingabire denied the charges saying they were intended to hurt her fight for democratic change in Rwanda. --BBC--
