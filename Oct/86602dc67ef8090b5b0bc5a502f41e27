The order is meant to boost the local manufacturing industry, a key plank in President Uhuru's Kenyatta so-called Big 4 Agenda. The order was communicated in a circular signed by Solicitor-General Kennedy Ogeto, who has confirmed its authenticity to Kenya's Daily Nation newspaper. It is unclear whether there will be disciplinary measures against those who don't comply. President Kenyatta and his deputy William Ruto led by example during Sunday's Heroes' Day celebrations in the coastal city of Mombasa, wearing Kenyan-made attires. Cabinet ministers and other state officials also wore similar outfits.
