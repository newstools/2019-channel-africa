Ingabire, 51, has denied any links to the 8 October attack which killed 14 people in Musanze district near Volcanoes National Park, a popular tourist spot. â€œI am fighting a political war but it is not a war of bullets," Ingabire told the BBC's Great Lakes Service last week. In a statement, FDU-Inkingi said that the police had summoned Ingabire for further questioning without her lawyer, despite knowing that they could not ask her any questions without her legal representative. "It seems to be done as a psychological ploy to wear down her mental capabilities and to humiliate her," the party said. "We call for the end psychological torture, degrading and inhuman treatment," the statement said. Last week, the police's investigation bureau spokesman said he could not give details about the on-going investigation into Ingabire. A strong critic of President Kagame, the FDU-Inkingi leader served eight years of a 15-year prison sentence for "belittling" the 1994 genocide after questioning why Rwanda's official memorial did not remember any of the Hutus who were murdered. Ingabire believes the case against her was politically motivated. Most of the 800 000 people killed were ethnic Tutsis but Hutu moderates were also slaughtered by the Hutu extremists. Since her release after a presidential pardon last year, she has had to report every month to the prosecutor's office.
