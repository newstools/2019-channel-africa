“This means 7.3 billion shillings became worthless pieces of paper,” bank governor Patrick Njoroge told journalists. The bank said there had been about 217 million of the notes in circulation on June 1, when the decision to phase them out was announced. The notes ceased to be legal tender from October 1. A total of 3 172 suspicious transactions were flagged during the demonetisation period and would be investigated by relevant government agencies, Njoroge said. The demonetisation aims to curb illicit financial flows. According to the Africa Tax Justice Network, Kenya has been losing $400 million every year since 2011 through illicit financial flows. The bank posted a tweet to declare the demonetisation successful. --BBC--
