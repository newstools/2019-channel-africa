The first ‘made in Rwanda’ phones rolled off the assembly line last week, the presidency said, through a partnership with Mara Group. “The Mara Phone joins a growing list of high-quality products that are made in our country. It is another milestone on our journey to high-tech, ‘made-in-Rwanda’ industry,” President Kagame said. In a series of tweets from the presidency, Kagame was quoted saying: “The introduction of Mara Phones will put smartphone ownership within reach of more Rwandans.” --TheEastAfrican--
