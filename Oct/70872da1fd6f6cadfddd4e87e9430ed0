In a statement, the International Organization for Migration said the workers - two men and one woman - were hit by crossfire during clashes between rival armed groups in the country’s central Equatoria region. It said the IOM had stopped screening for Ebola at five border points between South Sudan, Uganda and Democratic Republic of Congo, where an ongoing outbreak of the haemorraghic fever has killed thousands of people. The dead woman’s four-year-old son was abducted along with another local female IOM volunteer during the armed clash, the IOM said. 

Two other male volunteers were injured, including one who is recovering from a gunshot wound.
