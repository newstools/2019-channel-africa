President Filipe Nyusi secured another five-year term after a landslide win in the general election. He won 73% of the presidential vote. In the final results announced by the country’s national elections commission on Sunday, his Frelimo party won just under three quarters of the 250 parliamentary seats. The 17-member elections body approved the results by a vote of nine to eight. The opposition Renamo party has described the electoral process as a farce, citing alleged violations of the constitution. Independent observers have also described the vote as deeply flawed. Renamo leader, Ossufo Momade, has claimed vote rigging violated key agreements of the August’s peace deal it signed with the ruling party. The deal ended decades of conflict between the country's two biggest parties who fought a 1975-1991 civil war, with renewed hostilities from 2013-16. Renamo lost significant ground in the election, garnering 21% in the presidential contest. Many had believed a free and fair elections would put an end to the tensions between the two biggest parties and pave the way to lasting peace.
