The Sovereign Council, which is made up of civilian and military officials, confirmed that Supreme Court judge Neemat Abdulllah would head the country's judiciary. Although only two of the 11-member Sovereign Council in charge of Sudan are women, this latest appointment is seen as a significant step towards addressing gender inequality. Activists have been pushing for more female appointments, especially as so many women played a key role in the protests that led to the downfall of former President Omar al-Bashir. --BBC--
