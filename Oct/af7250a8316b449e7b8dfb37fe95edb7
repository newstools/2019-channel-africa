Each government-issued Mvuvi card - the word means “fisher” in Swahili - features a photo and fingerprint taken from its registered owner. Authorities will be able to read the cards using smartphones loaded with communications software that allows short-range wireless data transfers. Officials hope the cards, being used first in Lamu County, home to what the government says are about 60% of Kenya’s protected mangrove forests, will boost security and curb illegal fishing and logging. “There are people who pretend to be fishermen going out to sea but they are doing illegal logging of the mangroves,” Samson Macharia, commissioner of Lamu County, told the Thomson Reuters Foundation in a telephone interview. “Over-harvesting of mangroves will affect (impacts from) climate change and ecosystems all along the shores of the coast and the islands,” he added. Environmental scientists have long stressed the important role mangrove forests play in reducing global warming threats.
