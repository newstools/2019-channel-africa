The Clever Boys will now be confident of finishing the job when they play the return leg at home on 11 November. With two away goals in the bag, Wits will know a clean sheet at home will see them advance to the next stage of the continental tournament. The result will also be a welcome boost for coach Gavin Hunt after they put in a disappointing performance that saw them knocked out of the Telkom Cup after going down on penalties to Maritzburg United last week. The Students are also still very much in the domestic title race with them being seven points behind leaders Kaizer Chiefs, but they do have three games in hand on Amakhosi. Wits will now return home and have a week break before they prepare for the second leg against UD Songo.
