The experienced Serbian top-seed claimed a 6-4, 6-2 victory against 20-year-old Alexei Popyrin, who fought bravely at the Ariake Colosseum, a venue for the Tokyo 2020 Olympics. Djokovic added his shoulder felt "good" and declared that he has set his eyes on an Olympic medal next year. Popyrin mixed big serves with delicate drop shots to stage courageous offensives against 32-year-old Djokovic. But Djokovic, taking part in a Japanese competition for the first time, kept his calm to always stay a step above the Aussie, never giving his opponent a break point, consistently playing at a "high-level" with "good intensity." Djokovic nailed seven aces, against eight by Popyrin, and managed to win points on 84 percent of his successful first serves. He finished the roughly 90-minute match by winning the final five games straight. He will now face Japanese wild card Go Soeda on Wednesday. "Very pleased overall with the game," Djokovic said after the win. It was his first singles competition since he withdrew from his US Open fourth round match against Swiss Stan Wawrinka due to a left shoulder injury. Djokovic said he has no immediate worries about his shoulder. "I have not felt anything in previous days, including today on the match. So I am very pleased to say that I feel healthy," he said.
