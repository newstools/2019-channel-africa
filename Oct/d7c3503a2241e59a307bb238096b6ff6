In a $8.03 billion budget, Ng'andu abandoned a controversial sales tax on mines in favour of an existing Value Added Tax, which allows companies to claim back money spent on inputs and capital expenditure. With the International Monetary Fund warning that the country's debt was becoming unsustainable, Ngandu said Zambia would postpone and cancel some planned loans, refinance existing ones and stop offering guarantees for quasi-public entities. The treasury would also be more cautious in contracting new debt, he said, but still read a surplus budget which would be partially financed by external partners. “The government proposes to spend $8.03 billion in 2020, representing 32.4 % of GDP. Of this amount $5.5 billion will come from domestic revenues while the balance will be raised through domestic and external financing,” Ng’andu told legislators. Zambia’s external debt stock as at end-June 2019 increased to $10.23 billion. The country's budget year runs from January to December. --TheEastAfrican--
