According to a statement issued by SA Harvest, it is estimated that 10 million tons of the food produced in SA goes to waste annually, costing the country in excess of $4 billion.

SA Harvest is based on the Australian model called OzHarvest, which was started by ex-South African entrepreneur Ronni Kahn in 2004. The model is also being replicated in the UK Thailand and New Zealand. SA Harvest uses refrigerated vehicles to collect and deliver perishable and non-perishable foods, enabling their recipient organisations to get sufficient variety to provide full and nourishing meals to their people. This is a critical arm of the business, according to SA Harvest CEO Alan Browde. "We are able to raise awareness about food waste, food rescue, and food security and nutrition through sustainable and appropriate educational programmes and technologies that, inter alia, help people to become food self-sufficient," he explains.
