Two hours later at sunrise, the boat arrives at Kiangwe village, one of several remote coastal communities whose only healthcare comes from these monthly visits by the Safari Doctors mobile medical team. Volunteer doctors and nurses roll up their trousers and heave containers full of medical supplies onto their shoulders before wading ashore and hiking up a hill to a building that will serve as their clinic for a few hours. Kiangwe and surrounding villages have been hard-hit by the Kenyan government's war with Somali extremist group Al-Shabaab, whose militants operate from within the nearby Boni Forest which straddles the border. In the distance, between stick-and-mud houses topped with palm fronds, stands a shuttered clinic that was built but never occupied. "We have several buildings laying dormant because we have personnel (professional nurses and doctors) that don't want to get posted" to the region, said Umra Omar, the 36-year-old who founded Safari Doctors four years ago. So, every month, over a few days, her voluntary team made up of both Kenyan and foreign medics visits up to 12 villages, some of which require a last-minute phonecall to check on security. However four other villages in the region are considered no-go zones and have no healthcare access at all, said Omar. Thanks to donations and fundraising, the Safari Doctors mobile medical team treats up to 800 patients a month.
