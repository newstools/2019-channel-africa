He feels that this will be very helpful when he selects his squad to play Ghana and Sudan in the 2021 African Cup of Nations (AFCON) qualifiers which get underway next month. Ntseki is no new comer to this Bafana project and says almost all the players in the national team set-up currently, have been personally profiled by him for the past two years. One of the innovations that Ntseki wants to come up with is to have a large pool of players so as also to increase competition in the team. Bafana won the Mali game without the likes of Bongani Zungu, Percy Tau and Lebo Mothiba. There were other players who got an opportunity to play. Ntseki says he would be very happy to have a pool of around 100 players to choose from. Senior national teams are very special in many countries around the world, it becomes a project that’s owned by the whole nation and it’s also important for the technical team to have this vision.
