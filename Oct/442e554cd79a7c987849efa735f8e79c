At the age of 32, Djokovic is already considered one of the all-time greats of the sport as he has 16 Grand Slam titles to his name and has spent an incredible 275 weeks atop the world rankings. The Serb insists he could quit the sport any time, especially as he wants to spend more time with his family. "I have no obligation to play," he told French TV programme 'Do not touch my TV', with quotes translated by Express Sport. "I could leave tomorrow if I wanted since I am the father of two wonderful children and one is already five years old and starts school and stuff. "I would like to spend more of my time being more with them." However, fear not Djokovic fans, as the world No 1 hasn't lost his desire to play just yet. "I am happy to keep playing. I'm still motivated and inspired to play this beautiful sport."
