MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan .MIAPJ0000PUS rose 0.25%. Chinese shares .CSI300 advanced 0.31%, while Japan's Nikkei .N225 rose 0.30%. The pan-region Euro Stoxx 50 futures STXEc1 were up 0.22%, German DAX futures FDXc1 0.19% and FTSE futures FFIc1 just 0.04%. The pound slipped from a five-month high against the dollar and the euro after the British parliament forced Prime Minister Boris Johnson to seek a delay to an October 31 deadline for Britain’s departure from the bloc. The vote for an extension dealt a blow to optimism that a deal agreed last week would ensure Brexit happens with little economic disruption. Oil futures fell as lingering economic growth concerns and excess supplies of crude prompted speculators to trim their long positions. The Chinese stock market appeared to take some encouragement from comments by Chinese Vice Premier, Liu He, on Friday that Beijing will work with the United States to address each other’s concerns, and that stopping the trade war would be good for both sides and the world.
