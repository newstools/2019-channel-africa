The South African city is Air Zimbabwe's only international destination. The national carrier hasn't told reporters how much it had to pay out. "We resumed our flights on Friday and today, it must have gone to Johannesburg in the morning,‚Äù Air Zimbabwe's Corporate Services Manager Tafadzwa Mazonde is quoted by the Herald Newspaper as saying. "We got all the clearances and we have been allowed to resume operations. Of course, there were payment plans and everything," he added. Large debts prompted Air Zimbabwe to fire about half of it staff in 2017. It was also banned from flying in EU airspace, over safety concerns.
