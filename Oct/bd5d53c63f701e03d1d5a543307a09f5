They urged quick efforts to reschedule the negotiations, aimed at accelerating cuts in planet-warming emissions and helping vulnerable communities find ways to deal with the increasingly harmful impacts of climate change. The announcement by Chile’s president on Wednesday came just over a month before the negotiations - known as COP25 - were due to start and left the UN climate change secretariat scrabbling for an alternative venue. With so little time to reorganize an event that attracts more than 20 000 people, a spokesman for the UN body told the Thomson Reuters Foundation the annual conference may have to be postponed until 2020. Climate Action Network International, which represents hundreds of environmental campaign groups, warned Chile’s move “must not detract from the political urgency to address the climate crisis” through emissions reductions and stronger efforts to adapt to wilder weather and rising seas. “These are essential ingredients for climate justice. The postponing of the COP must not be used as an excuse to delay this,” the network said in a statement. Manuel Pulgar-Vidal, head of climate and energy work for conservation group WWF and president of the 2014 talks in Lima, called for a fast UN response in announcing updated plans for the conference.
