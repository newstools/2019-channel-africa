Moukoko netted for Borussia Dortmund in their 4-1 defeat to Inter Milan, and in doing so set the new youngest mark at 14 years 10 months and 29 days old.

It beat the previous record, held by Youri Reeger (Ajax Amsterdam) and Christos Liatsos (Olympiakos), who were both 16 years and 30 days old when they netted. Despite his tender age, Moukoko has long been a star on the rise and had now netted 106 goals in 69 games for the club’s development teams. Moukoko is already a Germany Under-16 international and has even caught the eye of senior coach Joachim Löw after starring for the Dortmund Under-19 side this season. “I’ve been speaking to Dortmund Under-19 coach Michael Skibbe for a while,” Löw told the Bundesliga’s official website. “Everyone involved is well advised to wait and let [Moukoko] develop in peace.” --AllAfrica--
