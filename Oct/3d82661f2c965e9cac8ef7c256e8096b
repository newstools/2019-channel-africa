Day, 27, had been in a coma for four days following his defeat and, despite having emergency brain surgery at Northwestern Memorial Hospital, doctors were unable to save the junior middleweight. “Patrick Day passed away today, October 16, 2019, succumbing to the traumatic brain injury he suffered in his fight this past Saturday, October 12, at the Wintrust Arena in Chicago, IL,” his promoter Lou DiBella said in a statement “He was surrounded by his family, close friends and members of his boxing team, including his mentor, friend and trainer Joe Higgins.” “On behalf of Patrick’s family, team, and those closest to him, we are grateful for the prayers, expressions of support and outpouring of love for Pat that have been so obvious since his injury.” Day was rushed to the hospital on a stretcher after Conwell landed a flurry of punches that left him motionless on the canvas.
