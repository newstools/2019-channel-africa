The agency estimates about 182 000 people have been displaced by the floods. Most of those displaced are from the central Somalia town of Beledweyne. Rescue and relief efforts are under way. A boat carrying at least 30 people capsized on Monday in the town leading to the death of at least 10 people while many others are thought to be missing.
