Sirak Asfaw who fled oppression in Ethiopia during the late 1970s, says he discovered the ornate gilded copper crown back in 1998, knew it had been stolen but had until recently felt it would not be safe to return it due to the political situation back home. The former refugee, who now works as a management consultant for the Dutch government, said it felt good to be giving back part of Ethiopia's cultural heritage. --BBC--
