Buhari commented on the video on Wednesday while hosting a delegation of wives of politicians who paid her a courtesy visit after her return from a two-month stay abroad. "I used the opportunity to apologise for the embarrassment I might have caused my children, my immediate family members, well-meaning Nigerians and the institution I represent, on the circulated leaked video clip," she posted on Instagram.

The president's niece, Fatima Mamman Daura, who recorded the video, recently told the BBC she filmed the video herself in 2018 but it had been circulated more recently by "mischief-makers".
