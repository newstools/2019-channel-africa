The musician had sang in support of Condé when he was a jailed opposition politician, but has now condemned him. Tiken Jah Fakoly told BBC he did not regret doing so but he did not think that "the person I was defending would one day" brutally crackdown on protesters. "I thought he was going to do like Nelson Mandela who was in prison for years and when he got out he did one term and then left," the singer added. A spokeperson for Condé's party said they were shocked by Tiken Jah Fakoly's comments, and he had denigrated and insulted the president. In September, Condé asked his government to look into drafting a new constitution, raising concerns that he might try to run for a third term in 2020. Last week, at least nine people were killed during protests against a possible change to the constitution. Footage emerged on social media showing police officers using batons to beat two protesters and, in one case, parading him naked while pretending to slit his throat, campaign group Human Rights Watch (HRW) said. The government, which initially justified a ban on the protests, eventually said it strongly condemned and regretted the violence. --BBC--
