Tau, who recently made his UEFA Champions League debut against Real Madrid, limped off in the first half with an ankle injury in his team's 4-0 victory on Saturday. South Africa have already been forced to replace defender Thamsanqa Mhkhize and goalkeeper Brandon Petersen due to injury. Bloemfontein Celtic's Tshepo Rikhotso and Ricardo Goss of Bidvest Wits have since received a call-up to the national squad. Bafana Bafana team doctor Thulani Ngwenya said South Africa also have injury concerns with Erick Mathoho, Bongani Zungu, Dean Furman and Themba Zwane. "From Tau's team, they didn't flag up anything so he's still coming to camp and then we will assess him and make a call, but otherwise there's nothing formal from his club," said Ngwenya. "Bongani had a deep laceration on his left leg, so we just need to open it and make a call on whether we're keeping him [in camp] or not; the other one is Tower [Mathoho] with an ankle injury so we'll manage him and see. "The other person which is of concern at the moment is Dean Furman, who has had a knee problem for about a week or so now, yes, I know he played (in the MTN8 final), but he might have pushed himself, so that's a concern. "Themba Zwane also has a niggling ankle injury, and I'm expecting to examine Ronwen Williams because he's also got a problem with his right shoulder, but they will all be assessed." The clash against Mali will be the first in charge for new Bafana coach Molefi Ntseki with the match scheduled to be played at the Nelson Mandela Bay Stadium on Sunday. Kick-off is at 15:00. --News24--
