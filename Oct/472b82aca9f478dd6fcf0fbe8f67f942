The leaders, who met at the Defence Ministry, have both said separately they were seeking to form a broad unity government, but with no clear path to success. After inconclusive elections in April and September, Gantz's nomination marked the first time since 2008 that someone other than 70-year-old Netanyahu has been asked by President Reuven Rivlin to build a ruling coalition. Gantz, head of the centrist Blue and White party, on Thursday was given 28 days to complete the task and failure could lead to a new election, the third within a year. Rivlin gave Netanyahu the chance to form a government first. But the prime minister, who leads the right-wing Likud party, said on Monday he was abandoning the effort, opening the way for Gantz, his strongest rival. Netanyahu remains caretaker premier until a new government is established. He has been prime minister consecutively since 2009, after a first term from 1996 to 1999, making him Israel's longest-serving leader.
