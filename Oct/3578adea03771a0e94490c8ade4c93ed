Troops patrolled main roads and public spaces in Baghdad, but by morning small, sporadic demonstrations had begun again in defiance of the open-ended curfew imposed in the capital from 5 am. Clashes overnight in southern cities more than doubled the death toll of three days of unrest, bringing it to 18. 

The demonstrations began in Baghdad on Tuesday and quickly grew and spread to other cities, mainly in Iraq’s south. Police fired live rounds, tear gas and water cannon to disperse protesters. Protesters directed their anger at a government and political class they say is corrupt and doing nothing to improve their lives. They demanded jobs, better services and called for the “downfall of the regime”. Curfews imposed in southern Iraqi cities overnight were lifted, local police said. Clashes during the night between protesters and security forces killed seven people including a policeman in Nassiriya, and four people in Amara, police and medics said. Iraq has struggled to recover from the battle against the Sunni Muslim hardline Islamic State group between 2014 and 2017. 

Its infrastructure has been laid to waste by decades of sectarian civil war, foreign occupation, two US invasions, UN sanctions and war against its neighbors. With the country at last at peace and free to trade, many Iraqis say their government has failed to rebuild the nation.
