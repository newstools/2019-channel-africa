Judge Roland Sutherland dismissed Mr Gordhanâ€™s application and ordered him to pay the legal costs of Malema, the leader of the Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF). Malema's comments were a "juvenile rant" and "puerile self-aggrandisement, not a threat to the applicant or anyone else," the judge was quoted by TimesLive as saying. EFF secretary-general, Godrich Gardee, welcomed the judgement. "The court was actually correct, because as the EFF we have a right and a privilege to freedom of speech as a political party," he said outside the court building in the main city, Johannesburg. Malema had targeted Gordhan, a former finance minister, believing he was behind his troubles with authorities over tax irregularities.
