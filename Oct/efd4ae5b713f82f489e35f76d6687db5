This is according to Nick Latta, Councillor: Prosperity at the UK High Commission in South Africa.

Latta told delegates at the Africa Ports and Rail Evolution conference in Durban on Wednesday that the goal set by the UK was to be the largest G7 investor in Africa in six years' time. "Brexit is quite complicated. I am not going to try and predict what will happen over the next 10 days or so. If I had a good answer to that, I would be a forex trader, not a diplomat," Latta said during a presentation which formed part of the KwaZulu-Natal Export Week segment. "We have big ambitions for trade with Africa, and especially South Africa, which is a leader and influencer for rest of Africa. "It is clear South Africa is a gateway for many businesses wanting to enter Africa, and many large African companies have headquarters in Johannesburg."   

He assured the audience that "[b]ar a few administrative details, any SA exporter will have the same access and experience when exporting to the UK which they have had until now.
