Low rainfall and waterlogging have destroyed many crops, the humanitarian groups say. A lack of drinking water caused by drought means that "people and animals, both livestock and wildlife, are having to use the same water points," says Zambia Red Cross's head, Kaitano Chungu. "This is unacceptable as it exposes people to diseases and creates a heightened risk of animal attacks." Food relief has been provided over the past few months, the ICRC says in a statement, but adds "more help is needed". --BBC--
