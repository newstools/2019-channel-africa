Edward Singhateh was one of four junior officers who carried out the coup in 1994 that brought Jammeh to power. Months later 11 soldiers were accused of launching a counter-coup. Singateh told the truth commission that he and Jammeh had agreed to execute the soldiers although he says he did not fire the shots. The commission is investigating alleged rights abuses during Jammeh's 22-year rule. He went into exile in 2017 after losing an election.
