The first of two “unidentified projectiles” was fired on Thursday at 4:35 p.m. local time (0735 GMT) from South Phyongan Province, in the center of the country, South Korea’s Joint Chiefs of Staff (JCS) said in a series of statements. 

A second projectile was detected at 4:38 p.m. (0738 GMT). The projectiles traveled an estimated 370 kilometers (230 miles) and reached an altitude of 90 kilometers (56 miles), the JCS said, calling them “short range”. Japanese authorities said they had landed outside Japan’s Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ), which extends 200 nautical miles (370 kilometers) from land.
