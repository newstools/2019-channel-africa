The presidential, legislative and provincial polls are widely expected to extend Frelimo’s decades-long rule over a southern African nation that is set to become one of the world’s main gas exporters. But Renamo is hoping to use electoral changes agreed in the peace pact to win control of its traditional heartlands in central and northern provinces for the first time since the civil war ended in a truce in 1992. A failure to make those gains could cause unrest and undermine the opposition’s incentive for sticking to the deal, rights groups and analysts have said. “Mozambique has chosen peace,” President Filipe Nyusi said after casting his ballot at a school in the capital Maputo. He praised Mozambicans for deciding their destiny in elections. Carlos Alberto, a 22-year-old student waiting to vote at the same secondary school said he wanted to see parliament hold the executive to account and push through promised reforms in education, work, housing and other areas. “We vote and then nothing happens,” he said of his country, which has only known one party in power since its hard-fought independence from Portugal in 1975. Like Alberto, most of the 13 million registered voters were born after that date.
