Celebrating its 100th anniversary, Tesco, which has a 27.4% share of Britain’s grocery market, is five years into a recovery plan that Lewis launched after a 2014 accounting scandal capped a dramatic downturn in trading. Murphy will become the second outsider to lead Tesco, following in the footsteps of former Unilever executive Lewis. And like Lewis, the 52-year old Irish national also has experience in the consumer goods industry - key suppliers to supermarkets - having started his career at Procter & Gamble. “Now is the right time for me to pass on the baton, our turnaround is complete,” Lewis told reporters on Wednesday. “We’ve delivered all the metrics we set for ourselves, the leadership team is very strong, our strategy is clear and it is delivering,” he said, adding he was not leaving for another job. The announcement of Lewis’s departure came as Tesco beat forecasts with a 25% rise in first-half operating profit before one of items of $1.7 billion and hiked its interim dividend 58.7%, underlining the progress he has made. Shares in the group were up 1.8% at 0900 GMT.
