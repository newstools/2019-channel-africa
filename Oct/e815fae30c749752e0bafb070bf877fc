The Egyptian authorities allegedly have arrested more than 2000 people in a massive sweep that followed peaceful protests on the 26th of September. The protests called for an end to widespread corruption and condemning the actions of the government of President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi. Many of those who have been arrested are said to include representatives of civil society, academics, and former politicians. --AfricaNews--
