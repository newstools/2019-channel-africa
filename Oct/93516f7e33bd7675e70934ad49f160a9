In 2018, the government said it planned to sell minority stakes in 23 state-owned companies in an initial phase of privatization, part of a plan to raise up to $4.97 billion. The program has been repeatedly delayed due to weak markets, legal hurdles, the readiness of each company’s financial documentation and in the case of some companies a downturn in the business cycle, a government adviser on the share sales said this month. The sale of minority stakes in two of the state companies are planned by year-end, officials have said. “The offerings being prepared by the Egyptian state should include a chance (for) the armed forces companies. In this way we will have opened a door for the Egyptian people and society to these companies,” Sisi said at a ceremony to inaugurate two new army chemicals factories in Abu Rawash, west of Cairo. He gave no details. Sisi said last year that Egypt plans to offer shares on the stock market of a $1.1 billion cement plant owned by the military, but no steps have yet been announced.
