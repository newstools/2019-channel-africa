At a media briefing to discuss global trend in tea prices, the state of the tea industry and the proposed Tea Bill in Kenya, the decline in international prices was blamed not only on overproduction amid depressed global demand but also currency devaluation and instability in key markets in Asia and Africa and international politics that have seen Iran slapped with more economic sanctions. Egypt, a market that nearly collapsed due to the Arab spring, has been hit by high inflation that reached highs of 20% in 2018 but is projected to drop to 14% this year while the United Kingdom continues to be unpredictable in the wake of uncertainties associated with Brexit. The high inflation rates in Sudan, which hit 70% and the recent political developments is another major worry for Kenya while the reintroduction of United States-led sanctions to Iran is bound to have far reaching ramifications to the tea sector. Global tea production in 2018 was estimated at 5.85 billion kilogrammes up from 5.81 billion kilogrammes in 2017, 0.68% increase with Africaâ€™s contribution standing at 717 million kilogrammes accounting for 12.2%. Total global exports were 1.8 billion kilogrammes, with Africa contributing 654 million kilogrammes accounting for 35%. However, global consumption posted a marginal 2.4% increase to 5.6 billion kilogrammes compared with 5.4 billion kilogrammes in 2017. --TheEastAfrican--
