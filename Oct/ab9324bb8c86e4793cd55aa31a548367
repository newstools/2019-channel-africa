Opposition politicians and activists have expressed outrage upon learning that several students were hospitalised after being beaten by soldiers. Police intervened to halt a press conference at the campus where student leaders were giving details of the raid. This video posted on Twitter by the privately owned television station NTV shows police confiscating the microphones and asking everyone to leave: Earlier this week dozens of students at Makerere were arrested during a demonstration where they were calling for tuition fees to be reduced. --BBC--
