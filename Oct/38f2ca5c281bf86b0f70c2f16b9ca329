Prime Minister Boris Johnson is pushing a vote in the House of Commons on Monday to trigger an early general election, saying it’s the only way to resolve the deadlock that has stopped the United Kingdom ratifying the divorce deal with Brussels and prolonged the uncertainty for businesses as Brexit drags on. 

Envoys representing the 27 remaining European Union members states agreed to the UK request for a Brexit extension to January 31, EU Council President Donald Tusk said on Twitter.  

The bloc’s decision will be formalised “through a written procedure,” Tusk said, meaning that there will be no leaders’ summit.

Envoys from the remaining 27 EU members states debate the wording of two separate documents this morning - a six-page legal decision granting an extension, and a two-page declaration explaining the reasoning. 

The main points of the documents, drafts of which were obtained by Bloomberg on Sunday, are as follows: Brexit will take place on the first day of the month following the ratification of the Withdrawal Agreement, “or on 1 February 2020, whichever is the earliest”. The Withdrawal Agreement isn’t up for renegotiation during the extension period. Note that EU leaders took a similar decision when they granted the previous extension in April, but broke their rule after Johnson’s government, with different red lines, took office.
