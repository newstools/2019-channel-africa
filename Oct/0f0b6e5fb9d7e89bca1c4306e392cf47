Assistant Inspector General of Police, Asuman Mugyenyi, said organisers of the concert failed to "heed minimum security standards," Nile Post news site reports. He cited lack of plans for medical care, traffic control, crowd control and security. The concert was to coincide with Wednesday's national Independence Day celebrations to be held in the eastern district of Sironko. Bobi Wine, whose real name is Robert Kyagulanyi, represents Kyadondo East constituency in Kampala. The aspiring presidential candidate is a fierce critic of President Yoweri Museveni and portrays himself as a champion of the poor. He told journalists last week that the concert will go ahead despite failure by police to respond to a letter asking for clearance to stage the event. The concert's cancellation comes in the wake of a government ban on the wearing of red berets by civilians, a trademark Bobi Wine has adopted for his People Power movement. Under a new legislation announced last month, the red beret was reserved for the army and Uganda People's Defence Forces, only. --BBC--
