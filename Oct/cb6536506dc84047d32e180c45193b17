On Tuesday, for example, J&J announced that other labs it hired ultimately found no asbestos in samples from the bottle tested by the US Food and Drug Administration or from the same production lot. In challenging the FDA’s finding, however, the healthcare giant is casting doubt on one of its own experts. The private Maryland lab that found asbestos in Baby Powder under a contract with the FDA is run by a paid expert witness for J&J. Andreas Saldivar, laboratory director of AMA Analytical Services Inc, has served as a litigation expert on several occasions for J&J since 2017 in its defense against plaintiffs’ claims that asbestos in talc caused their cancers. He testified in a May 2018 deposition that testing he did in 2010 for the FDA showed no evidence of asbestos in Johnson’s Baby Powder, helping to bolster the company’s argument that its iconic brand is safe. Saldivar’s lab began testing cosmetic talc products for the FDA again this year, and in September it found asbestos in an unmarked sample that the FDA later identified as Johnson’s Baby Powder.
