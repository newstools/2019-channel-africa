US Representative, Peter DeFazio, who heads the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee that will hear from Muilenburg on Wednesday, said in a written statement that the committee’s lengthy investigation into the MAX has turned up significant questions about Boeing’s decision-making. “Something went drastically wrong, a total of 346 people died, and we have a duty to fix it,” DeFazio will say in his opening statement. DeFazio said the panel is aware of “at least one case where a Boeing manager implored the then-Vice President and General Manager of the 737 program to shut down the 737 MAX production lines because of safety concerns.” Boeing did not comment Tuesday on the allegation. Muilenburg on Tuesday acknowledged errors in failing to give pilots more information on a key safety system known as MCAS before the crashes, as well as for taking months to disclose that it had made optional an alarm that alerts pilots to a mismatch of flight data on the 737 MAX.
