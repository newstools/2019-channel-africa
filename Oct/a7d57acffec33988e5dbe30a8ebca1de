Thousands joined the peaceful march throughout the capital, Port-au-Prince, that underscored how more and more sectors of society are rising up against what they view as not only President Jovenel Moise's bad governance but also a broken political system. Meanwhile, a group of some 15 university students from various Haitian schools lied languidly on a classroom floor as their hunger strike to demand Moise step down entered its tenth day. "Corruption is like a cancer for society. Repression and injustice are turning into the norm in Haitian society.

"Because of the problems we face, we students from various universities started this unlimited hunger strike to demand that (President) Jovenel Moise step down," said law student Mackenson Jean. There have been several waves of protests since Moise took power in February 2017, but this is the longest. While protesters originally were calling for Moise to fix the country's problems, they have been dismayed by his inaction and are now calling outright for his resignation. --Reuters--
