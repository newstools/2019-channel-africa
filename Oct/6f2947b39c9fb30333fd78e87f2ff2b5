Greeg Schoof had been arrested for holding an "illegal meeting with journalists in a public space," police spokesperson John Bosco Kabera told AFP. Pastor Schoof owned a Christian radio station, Amazing Grace Radio FM, which was banned last year after it was accused of promoting division in the country. The radio station had caused widespread anger last year after a local pastor said on-air that women were “dangerous creatures of evil, going against God’s plans”. Pastor Schoof said he had been denied access to a venue he had booked to give a press conference before he left Rwanda. As he stood outside complaining to journalists, police arrived and arrested him. In a press release entitled Before I leave, Pastor Schoof said the Rwandan government “has taken a stand against God with its heathen practices”. “Christian radio illegally closed, 7000 churches illegally closed, condoms are promoted to children in schools which promotes filth.” his statement reads. --BBC--
