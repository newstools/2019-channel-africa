The spokesperson for former rebel leader Riek Machar said he did not believe he would be able to join a unity government on November 12, a deadline agreed in September after months of talks, broken ceasefires and pressure from the United Nations, the United States (US) and regional powers. There was no immediate comment from President Salva Kiir or from other countries that helped broker the accord. US officials said this month they would not accept any more delays and might impose sanctions if deadlines are not met. “It’s not rocket science that the government in Juba lacks political will to implement the peace deal,” Machar’s spokesperson, Puok Both Buluang, said. He called on the government to release funds it had agreed to spend on rolling out the accord. The extra six months would “give room” for resolving issues, he added.
