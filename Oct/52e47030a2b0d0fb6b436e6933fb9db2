On Wednesday Eskom was forced to impose first power cuts for the first time in around seven months, highlighting the challenge facing President Cyril Ramaphosa in rescuing the state company, which has been beset by financial and technical problems, and putting further pressure on the economy. Eskom said it would cut 2 000 megawatts (MW) of power from 9 am (0700 GMT) until 11 pm (2100 GMT) on Thursday on a rotational basis across the country. “Contingency measures have been put in place to manually feed coal to Medupi (power plant) whilst we look into a permanent solution to the coal conveyor belt failure at the station,” Eskom said. “We have started receiving additional diesel supplies from the major oil service providers and as such we are comfortable that we can build the necessary diesel and water reserves to acceptable levels over the weekend.” Late on Wednesday Eskom said some generating units have already returned to service and it expects more units to return to service over the next few days. South Africa's rand ZAR=D3 currency fell as much as 1% against the dollar on Wednesday after Eskom announced the cuts.
