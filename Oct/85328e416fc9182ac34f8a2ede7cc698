He will pilot the KTM RC16 next after spending three seasons in the Moto2 category, racking up five wins and 12 podium finishes to date. He made his debut back in 2014 as a Red Bull MotoGP Rookies Cup race winner in his second stint with Red Bull KTM Ajo, while also grabbing his first piece of silverware in the same year. Two years later he claimed the world title and in the process became South Africa’s first world champion in 36 years and just the third from his country. Upon his promotion to Moto2, he started slow but soon gained momentum winning his second race of the season at Aragon, Spain in mid-September. That result made it two wins and three podiums in the last seven races.
