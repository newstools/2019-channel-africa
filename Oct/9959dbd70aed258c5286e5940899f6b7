Democrats said they were making progress every day, rejecting criticism from US President Donald Trump and some Republicans who have accused them of stalling a vote on the deal that replaces the 1990s-era North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA). Lighthizer and other US trade officials met on Wednesday with a working group of Democrats in the U.S. House of Representatives, according to three sources familiar with the matter. Lighthizer also met with Republicans on the House Ways and Means Committee, said one of the sources. In addition, his staff met with congressional staff on Monday and Tuesday, according to two of the sources. The US Trade Representative’s (USTR) office did not immediately comment. Despite the positive signals, Senate Finance Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley, a Republican, said in a speech on the Senate floor that he feared the Democratic-controlled House was “increasingly less likely to act this year on USMCA.”
