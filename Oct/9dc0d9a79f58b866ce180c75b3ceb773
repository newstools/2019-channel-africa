Uncertainties linger about its long-standing quality issues, which have invited investigations from US regulators and prosecutors after a whistleblower claimed in 2016 that Hyundai and affiliate Kia Motors should have recalled more vehicles over engines catching fire. The prolonged quality woes overshadow efforts by the automaker to steer a recovery following six consecutive years of profit declines at a time when it is stepping up spending to catch up in the global auto technology race. Last month, it announced a $1.6 billion investment in a joint venture to develop self-driving vehicle technologies with Aptiv. Hyundai Motorâ€™s third-quarter net profit rose 59% to 427 billion won ($364.75 million), compared with the average 684 billion profit estimate of analysts based on Refinitiv data. That also compared with 269 billion won booked in the same period a year earlier when its profit took a dive because of costs related to engine and airbag quality issues. Hyundai Motor said earlier that it has earmarked another 600 billion won to settle some of the US engine-related lawsuits, install software to detect potential engine failures and offer lifetime warranties for faulty engines. Its total retail sales fell 3% in the third quarter from a year earlier, with the US sales recovery offset by drops in China and South Korean sales. A favourable South Korean currency and more sales of sport utility vehicles helped support US sales, while China sales remained dismal after Hyundai closed one of its factories in Beijing.
