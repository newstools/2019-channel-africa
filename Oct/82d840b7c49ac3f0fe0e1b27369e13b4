The moderate Islamist party Ennahda, which is part of the outgoing government, said it had won the ballot in a briefing to journalists. Earlier officials from the new Qalb Tounes party of the jailed media tycoon and presidential contender, Nabil Karoui, said it had topped the poll. The largest party in parliament will nominate a prime minister. The polls come a fortnight after the first round of the presidential election, when independent candidates side-lined traditional political elites. --BBC--
