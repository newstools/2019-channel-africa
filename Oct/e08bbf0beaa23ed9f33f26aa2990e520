Rotich clocked 1:43.47, behind America’s Donovan Brazier who won gold with 1:42.34, and Amel Tuka of Bosnia at 1:43.82. Uganda’s Halimah Nakaayi pulled off one of this year’s biggest upsets when she won the women’s 800m category, beating pre-race favourite Ajee Wilson who only managed bronze. Uganda was perfectly poised to make history, as it had two finalists in the race, the first time the country was featuring in the World Championships finals. “I was feeling so good, I knew something special was going to happen tonight,” said Nakaayi, whose only previous big meet medal came at the All Africa Games in August, where she took bronze. “So I just kept pushing and pushing. I was feeling strong and in the end I got it.” Nakaayi celebrated with her compatriot, Winnie Nanyondo, who finished fourth in 1:59.18. Nakaayi returns to action on Wednesday in the heats of the 1500m. --AfricaNews--
