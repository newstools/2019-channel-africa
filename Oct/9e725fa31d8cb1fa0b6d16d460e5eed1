Former Bafana Bafana coach Clive Barker believes South African football has been plummeting since the mid-1990s when they won the Africa Cup of Nations. The 75-year-old was at the helm when Neil Tovey famously raised the continental crown 23 years ago at Soccer City in Johannesburg. But they have declined heavily since and Barker says the country did not do enough justice by jumping on the winning bandwagon all those years ago. The former AmaZulu FC, Maritzburg United and Bidvest Wits coach is now trying to do his bit to try and raise South African football from the dust. Speaking at his recent academy launch in Durban, he has undertaken to unearth the next Doctor Khumalo. He hopes to do this by starting right at the bottom and working with lower age-group levels of seven to 14. The veteran coach outlined what he hoped the new initiative will achieve. Other key areas the academy was targeting is to host holiday camps, the first of which was held at the end of September. It also wants to partner with schools and educate coaches. Barker says there was huge potential for the coastal city to unearth new stars. Barker concedes that quality players were key towards building a sound footballing future for South Africa. That is what he was hoping the academy, which will be based at the Crusaders Club in Durban North, will stride towards.
