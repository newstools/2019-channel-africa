The all-rounder first claimed an impressive three for 22 in nine overs to help her side bundle out their hosts for 146 in 45.5 overs - their second lowest score ever against the tourists. She then struck an innings-high 29 off 43 balls, but it was not enough as the South Africans were shot out for 140 in 48 overs. That left them just short as they ended the month-long trip on a low note – India’s win concluding a 3-0 series sweep and a disappointing end for coach Hilton Moreeng and his charges in a match where they showed so much of promise. It started from the beginning when the home side won the toss and opted to bat first, with Kapp and fellow fast bowler Shabnim Ismail (2/18) strangling them up front by reducing the score to 23 for three inside the first 12 overs, thanks to their early hits and five maidens between them. Harmanpreet Kaur (38) and Shikha Pandey (35) helped their team recover to 120 for six, but Ayabonga Khaka (2/33), Sune Luus (1/15), Tumi Sekhukhune (1/27) and Nondumiso Shangase (1/28) cleaned up the tail to give India their lowest score against them since they made 114 in Bengaluru in 2014.
