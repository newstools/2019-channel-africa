One source familiar with the matter said LVMH, which owns the Louis Vuitton and Bulgari brands among others, had proposed a bid valuing Tiffany at about $120 per share. That would be equivalent to a $14.5 billion acquisition offer – which would make it the acquisitive French group’s biggest purchase to date. “In light of recent market rumours, LVMH Group confirms it has held preliminary discussions regarding a possible transaction with Tiffany,” the company said in a statement. “There can be no assurance that these discussions will result in any agreement.” That would be a sharp premium to Tiffany’s current share price, which closed at $98.55 on Friday. Cash-rich LVMH did not give any financial details. Another source familiar with the situation, said the French group had submitted a preliminary, non-binding offer to Tiffany earlier in October. LVMH shares were up 1% in early trading, touching highs last seen in July. “LVMH has ample financial capacity for a deal and we also expect many strategic and financial synergies,” analysts at Cowen said in a note.
