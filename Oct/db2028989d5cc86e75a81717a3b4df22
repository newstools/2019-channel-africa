The Scots, the top seeds going into the qualifying tournament, had finished a disappointing fourth in Group A. But they responded with their second biggest T20 victory as UAE fell to 108 all out chasing Scotland's 198-6. Opener George Munsey top scored with 65 and admitted it was "nice" to find his form in a decider. "It's not gone our way this tournament, but it's great to play so well in a must-win game," Munsey, who was named player of the match, said. Munsey paid tribute to fellow batsman Richie Berrington, saying it was "fantastic the way he took it out" in the middle order by adding 48 runs. Captain Kyle Coetzer, who hit 34 in his opening partnership with Munsey, suggested the future was bright for Scotland with "a lot of fine players", despite a surprise opening defeat by Singapore and subsequent losses to Namibia and Netherlands. "We are very lucky to be where we are, but progression is what we are looking for," he said. Six places were up for grabs for next year's finals in Australia alongside Sri Lanka and Bangladesh in the first-round group stage. All four teams to reach the tournament semi-finals have qualified for the T20 World Cup, Group A winners Papua New Guinea face Namibia in one semi-final, while Group B winners Ireland take on the Netherlands. Oman beat Hong Kong by 12 runs later on Wednesday to secure the final qualification place. Oman slipped to 42-6 but a vital unbeaten 67 from opener Jatinder Singh saw them post 134-7. Hong Kong fell to 18-5 in reply and, despite 44 from wicketkeeper Scott McKechnie, could only reach 122-9 off their 20 overs, with Oman's Bilal Khan taking four wickets. Scotland will face Oman in a fifth-place play-off on Thursday. --BBC--
