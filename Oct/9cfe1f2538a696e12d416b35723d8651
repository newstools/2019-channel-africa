It said that Uganda was against foreign interference in the matter, adding that "Hong Kong affairs are China's domestic affairs". The statement also said that it "firmly supports" China's "one country, two systems" policy which gives Beijing direct control over Hong Kong. Hong Kong was a British colony for more than 150 years - part of it, Hong Kong Island, was ceded to the UK after a war in 1842. Later, China also leased the rest of Hong Kong - the New Territories - to the British for 99 years. Hong Kong has its own legal system and borders, and rights including freedom of assembly and free speech are protected. Pro-democracy activists accuse China of trying to take these guarantees away. --BBC--
