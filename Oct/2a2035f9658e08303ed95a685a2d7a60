The president was speaking at the Financial Times Africa Summit, in London, on Monday. He delivered the opening address at the summit, which is a gathering of investors and business people. During a question and answer session, he shared more on government's position on private sector participation in state-owned enterprises (SOEs), like the national carrier.

"We have put on record we are open to participation of the private sector with regard to some of our SOEs," he said. "We are talking to a few interested parties when it comes to SAA, for instance," he added. Bloomberg previously reported that Ethiopian Airlines Group would consider buying a stake in SAA. The two airlines are already partners through the Star Alliance. Ethiopian Airlines this year received the African Champion of the Year Award at the Africa CEO Forum which took place in Kigali, Rwanda, just a few weeks after the fatal Boeing 737 MAX 8 crash. Ethiopian Airlines has successfully established intra-African partnerships across 40 countries on the continent. This is a stark contrast to SAA, which is in a dire financial position.
