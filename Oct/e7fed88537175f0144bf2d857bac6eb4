Zuma, in office from 2009-2018, had applied for the stay of prosecution for alleged fraud, racketeering and money laundering relating to the deal to buy European military equipment for South Africa’s armed forces in the 1990s. On Friday the Pietermaritzburg High Court dismissed the application by Zuma and his co-accused, French arms company Thales. “Mr Zuma elects to exercise the full extent of his constitutional rights, which includes the right to appeal (this) ... decision,” Zuma’s lawyer, Thabani Masuku, told the court, where pre-trial proceedings were set to start. Zuma’s lawyers and state prosecutors had agreed to provisionally set down Feb. 4, 2020 as a trial start date. But State prosecutor Billy Downer said the state intended to oppose the appeal, potentially delaying any trial deep into 2020. Ousted by the ruling African National Congress in February 2018 after two terms in power marked by corruption allegations and economic stagnation, Zuma has claimed the charges are a politically motivated conspiracy.
