Police chief Martin Okoth Ochola has written to regional police commanders, instructing them to comply with the President's directive. In a report in 2016, a non-governmental organisation, the Human Rights Awareness and Promotion Forum (HRAPF), said the arrests took place under "vagrancy laws" introduced during British colonial rule and mostly targeted poor people who had no permanent home or employment. The President also ordered that no person be arrested under the law in future, the privately owned Daily Monitor newspaper reports. This is the third time that President Museveni has made the order, the last one being in his State of the Nation Address in 2017. Museveni's previously promised to repeal legislation which criminalised "idle and disorderly' behaviour, but the promise remains unfulfilled. Ochola said the president has also ordered the release of hawkers imprisoned in the capital, Kampala, for failing to pay fines of $272 after being caught selling goods illegally on pavements, the Daily Monitor reports. --BBC--
