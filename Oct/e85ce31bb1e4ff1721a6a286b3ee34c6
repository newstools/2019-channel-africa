In a speech to young entrepreneurs in Johannesburg, his wife Meghan by his side, Harry said he drew inspiration from Africans’ generosity and resilience. He made no reference to a lawsuit the couple has filed against a British tabloid newspaper that cast a shadow over the end of their trip. "Despite extreme hardship and ongoing challenges on so many levels, people are generous, they are strong, humble and incredibly optimistic," Harry said. Striking a very personal note, he said visiting Africa from boyhood had helped him come to terms with the tragic death of his mother Princess Diana in a car crash in Paris in 1997. "Africa has held me in an embrace that I will never forget ," he said. "I always feel, wherever I am on this continent - that the community around me provides a life that is enriching, and is rooted in the simplest things, connection, connections with others and the natural environment." Echoing her husband’s warm words, a beaming Meghan said Africa’s potential was "astronomical". Harry’s speech came a day after the couple began legal proceedings against the Mail on Sunday newspaper over the publication of a private letter. 

Harry accused sections of the British press of “bullying” and compared the treatment he said his wife was having to endure to that suffered by Diana.
