Both Comair, the company operating low-cost airline kulula.com, and British Airways in South Africa issued a notice to its passengers. It said the grounding "related to irregular findings picked up during a recent audit of our maintenance and technical service provider, South African Airways Technical". State-owned South African Airways (SAA) also had some of its planes delayed or cancelled. Passengers at the country’s busiest airport, Johannesburg's OR Tambo International, voiced their unhappiness about the lack of communication. Many were anxiously standing in queues as they waited to check in their luggage amid long delays. SAA’s Spokesperson, Tlali Tlali, said it was a precautionary measure. Transport Minister, Fikile Mbalula, told journalists that there was no crisis. “We are pleased that SAA technical has submitted a corrective action plan and it was accepted," he said. "The safety of our people is paramount and we want to ensure that our airlines meet the safety standards.”
