Robert Lighthizer, the United States Trade Representative, US Treasury Secretary, Steven Mnuchin, and Chinese Vice Premier Liu will speak by telephone Friday, their latest attempt to calm a nearly 16-month trade war that is roiling financial markets, disrupting supply chains and slowing global economic growth. The two sides are working to try to agree on a text for a “Phase 1” trade agreement announced by US President Donald Trump on October 11, in time for him to sign it with China’s President Xi Jinping next month at a summit in Chile. So far, Trump has only agreed to cancel an October 15 increase in tariffs on $250 billion in Chinese goods as part of understandings reached on agricultural purchases, increased access to China’s financial services markets, improved protections for intellectual property rights and a currency pact. But to seal the deal, Beijing is expected to ask Washington to drop its plan to impose tariffs on $156 billion worth of Chinese goods, including cell phones, laptop computers and toys, on December 15, two US-based sources told Reuters. Beijing also is likely to seek removal of 15% tariffs imposed on Sept. 1 on about $125 billion of Chinese goods, one of the sources said.

Trump imposed the tariffs in August after a failed round of talks, effectively setting up punitive duties on nearly all of the $550 billion in US imports from China.
