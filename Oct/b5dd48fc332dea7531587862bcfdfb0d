In a statement, the social media giant said it will now prominently label content rated false by third-party fact checkers on Facebook and Instagram. Facebook recently expanded its fact-checking programme to 10 new countries across Sub-Saharan Africa: Ethiopia, Zambia, Somalia, Burkina Faso, Uganda, Tanzania, Democratic Republic of Congo, Ivory Coast, Guinea and Ghana. Head of Policy for Africa Kojo Boakye said the programme will be implemented through its partners such as Africa Check, Pesa Check, Dubawa, France 24 and AFP Fact Check in a bid to control the flow of misinformation on its platforms. “Taking steps to help tackle false news on Facebook is a responsibility we take seriously, we know misinformation is a problem, and these are important steps in continuing to address this issue”, said Boakye. --BBC--
