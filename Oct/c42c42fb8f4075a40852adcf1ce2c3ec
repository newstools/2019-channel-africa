Supreme Court Judge Nemat Abdullah Khair was nominated by the judges’ professional association, which was part of a protest movement that helped oust veteran ruler Omar al-Bashir in April. Taj-Elsir Ali, a former prosecutor and lawyer, was named as the public prosecutor, a government statement said. The two judicial officials “will carry out their tasks in addressing corruption cases and other cases”, the sovereignty council member spokesman said in a statement without giving details. The Sudanese opposition used to accuse the judiciary of being a tool of the Bashir regime to suppress dissent and lock up opposition figures. Sudan in August formed a 11-member Transitional Sovereignty Council as part of a power-sharing deal between the military and civilian parties and protest groups. The council, formed of military leaders and civilians, will run the country for a three-year transitional period until elections. A cabinet was also formed in September, including the country’s first female foreign minister, Asmaa Abdallah.
