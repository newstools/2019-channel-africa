Goals from Joseph Banda and Rickson Ng'ambi gave Zambia the victory, despite them playing most of the second half with 10 men after Peter Chikolo was sent off for two yellow cards. This was Zambia's second triumph in the southern African regional competition having also lifted the U-17 trophy in 2017. Angola, the 2018 champions, were emphatic 5-0 winners over eSwatini in the third-place play-off to take bronze. Angolan striker Valdemiro Domingos hit a hat-trick and finished the tournament with five goals to share the Golden Boot with Zambia's Ng'ambi and Mozambique's Simon Cipriano. Zambia's Moses Mulenga was named Player of the Tournament with goalkeeper Iford Mwale, also of Zambia, winning the Golden Glove.
