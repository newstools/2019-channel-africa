The WTO has found that both Airbus and its US rival Boeing (BA.N) received billions of dollars of illegal subsidies in a pair of cases that have run for 15 years.

“We regret the choice of the US to move ahead with tariffs. This step leaves us no alternative but to follow through in due course with our own tariffs in the Boeing case, where the US has been found in breach of WTO rules,” Malmstrom said. The United States imposed tariffs on $7.5 billion of EU imports on Friday. An adjudication on damages in the Boeing case is expected early in 2020.
