Trouble erupted when the home side were awarded a 73rd minute penalty after Obriel Chirinda was fouled by CAPS goalkeeper Tonderai Mateyaunga, and referee Happy Mabhena pointed to the spot. CAPS players and the technical team protested vehemently, while missiles rained down from unhappy fans in the stands, which forced a six-minute delay in the game. The players at one stage camped in their dug-out and looked as though they would refuse to play on, before sanity prevailed. It was not quite as chaotic as the 16-minute delay forced in the clash between Dynamos an Platinum FC when the referee on that occasion turned down a penalty appeal, but there is a worrying trend of growing violence at Zimbabwe football matches. Chicken Inn won the game with CAPS 1-0, and the drama did not end there as, after the final whistle, CAPS United Blessing Sarupinda appeared to make physical contact with the referee and striker Dominic Chungwa had to be restrained by the home teamâ€™s security guards as he appeared to be seeking a fist-fight with the official. The fracas was only calmed when more police arrived to quell the tensions, but the CAPS team bus required a police escort from the stadium as home supporters vented their unhappiness. The result means CAPS remain top of the Premier League table, four points ahead of Chicken Inn and FC Platinum with three rounds of matches to play --AllAfrica--
