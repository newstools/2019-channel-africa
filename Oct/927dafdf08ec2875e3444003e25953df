The move follows reported incidents of discrimination against some Muslim women at work and in schools. The latest incident comes after an invigilator for the West African Examinations Council asked a candidate to remove her hijab before sitting her exams. Thousands of Muslims staged protests on Saturday in key cities across the country to push for an end to discrimination. Sheikh Armiyawo Shaibu, the Spokesperson for Ghanaâ€™s Chief Imam, said public officials who discriminate against Muslims must "suffer sanctions, adding: The sanctions must be made public to send a message." Muslim youth have also started a social media campaign using the hashtag #HijabIsAnIdentity calling for the end to discrimination. Ghana is officially a secular country and the constitution prohibits all forms of discrimination. --BBC--
