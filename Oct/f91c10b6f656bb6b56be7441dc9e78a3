Critics accuse President Sisi of spending large amounts of money on castles, luxurious villas and a new capital city, while many Egyptians suffer from growing poverty. During a speech to parliament in which he was trying to justify Sisi's spending, Ali Adelal reportedly said: "Hitler also made mistakes when he expanded East and West but he built fantastic infrastructure for his country which was the basis of the development in todayâ€™s Germany". He praised "the infrastructure that Germany has constructed, which is a model for the whole world". However, according to Egypt Today, he later clarified: "No-one can praise Hitler for his actions against humanity. No country can develop without a strong infrastructure and this is the only thing I was referring to in my statements." "Hitler committed a lot of crimes against the world and I cannot praise him," he said.
