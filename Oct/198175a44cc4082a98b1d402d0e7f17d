"In that locality, there is a mud layer of 1.5m which showed a sign of disturbance by an artificial object that is not common in the sea," the paper reports an official as saying. The divers used a multi-beam system that is able to look at the sea bed in three dimensions. The images will be analysed to further narrow the search area. Kenyans have criticised the recovery effort, saying that it once again proved the poor state of the country's disaster preparedness. The family of the victims, a woman and her daughter, have also hired private divers to join the recovery operation. --BBC--
