The talented attacker is certain his side’s recent 2-0 win over West Ham United in an English Premier League clash can act as a “turning point” in their campaign. Everton tore into West Ham from the outset on Saturday and the Blues’ margin of victory could conceivably have been far wider. “It was a great team performance and we are all buzzing. We needed a turning point and I think today is the day,:” Iwobi said on the club’s website. “The manager told us after the international break that we had to be confident, to not feel any sort of pressure. “He said, ‘Just play and express yourselves and be free’. We took that into training… and you can see from the players today, we were able to that in the match.” Everton climbed four places to 14th and within four points of a top-six spot following their weekend success – which curbed a run of four straight Premier League defeats. --AllAfrica--
