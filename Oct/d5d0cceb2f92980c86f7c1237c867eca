The marketing season in Ivory Coast, the world’s top cocoa producer, is underway with a new farmgate price of $1.39 per kilograms set by the government early in October. Farmers in the central and the southern regions said rainfall last week was the heaviest they had seen in the past five years, making it difficult to dry and load beans. “It’s complicated. We can’t dry well and there is sure to be a lot of moisture in the deliveries in the coming days,” said Roger Boka, who farms ON the outskirts of the southern region of Agboville. Farmers said the main cocoa crop was promising as trees have a good yield, but said a continuation of heavy rains could cause young pods and cherelles to fall from trees. Black pod disease was spreading in several plantations due to high moisture levels but crop losses should be limited, they said.
