The deal values the infrastructure at €1.9 billion ($2 billion) including debt. Following the close of the transaction, Sonatrach will be the main shareholder with a 51% stake, while Naturgy will hold the remaining 49%. Naturgy will pay €445 million ($491.1 million) to Mubadala for a 34% stake and structure the deal through a special purpose vehicle. It said it might sell a stake in this vehicle, which will be funded with a €260 million ($286 million) loan, to a financial partner. Naturgy said it expected the deal to close by the end of March 2020 and the stake should pay annual dividends of more than €130 million ($143 million). --Reuters--
