Its share price jumped more than 8% to R66.47 in the first hour of trading. Its comparable turnover was up 6% to $3 billion. In South Africa, prices at its stores rose by 2.2% compared to the same period IN 2018.

This is a reversal from the year to March, when Pick n Pay’s prices fell by 0.3%. Pick n Pay stressed that the 2.2% rise is still below food price inflation. Annual food inflation reached its highest level in 18 months, registering 3.8% in August, according to Statistics SA. Under new Chief Executive Officer Richard Brasher, a former Tesco exec, Pick n Pay has competed aggressively on price. This has helped the chain gain market share after it lost customers in recent years. It also reduced its labour force by a tenth and streamlined operations, investing in logistics and new stores. Tighter margin management and improved efficiency helped to deliver a 16.4% increase in underlying trading profit in South Africa, the group said. It launched more than 320 new own brand products this year, which now represent more than a fifth of sales in specific categories. 

Two million customers visited Pick n Pay’s online shop, with sales growth of 17%. Some 850 000 of its customers have joined its partner bank TymeBank.
