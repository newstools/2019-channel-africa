In the past, corporate culture was structured on the basis of race and all the jobs with perks were reserved for white people. Today, governmentâ€™s Employment Equity and Skills Development Acts seek to redress these discriminatory past injustices. However, companies are dragging their feet in complying with the legislation. While there are reasonable improvements in lower management structures, the middle to upper occupational levels still under-represent the Black majority. White South Africans, particularly males, are still over-represented in top management. Whites occupy 65.5% of top management positions, Blacks 15.1%, Indians 9.7% and the Coloured people 5.3%. There are also claims that the stereotype of Black people being less capable still persists. Black people are largely still receiving less favourable treatment than white counterparts who are viewed as the epitome of professionalism and excellence.
