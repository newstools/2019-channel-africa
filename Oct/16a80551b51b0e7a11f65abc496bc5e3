While he doesn't recognise some of the new faces on the local tour, he still remembers his first professional victory, which came in this Vodacom Origins of Golf series. Coetzee was a rookie professional on the Sunshine Tour in 2007 when he won his first title in the Vodacom Origins of Golf at Selborne. "I remember that first win very fondly. I remember on 16 I hit it within half a millimetre out of bounds. Then on 17 I hit it within a foot of out of bounds. And on 18 I up-and-downed out of the bunker to win by two. I'm excited for this week. It's been a long year and it's nice to come back home. And you can't get a much better place than this. The golf course is amazing. It's perfect," he said at Simola on Wednesday. "I looked at the entry list for this tournament though and didn't recognise half the names because a new generation has come through. A couple of my regular guys like Justin Harding and Louis de Jager are on the European Tour now. But there are still a few familiar faces here." Coetzee has had four Top-10s on the European Tour this season and is currently within the Top 60 on the Race to Dubai.
