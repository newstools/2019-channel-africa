Ndegwa joins Safaricom from alcoholic drinks company Diageo where he was the Managing Director of Diageo Continental Europe, the first African to hold the role. He takes over from Bob Collymore, the highly successful Briton who died of Cancer in July. Under Collymore, Safaricom’s net profit surged to an unprecedented $600 million in 2019 - the highest of any company in eastern Africa. Most of that was owed to mobile money services Mpesa, which is used by half of Kenya’s 40 million people to pay for anything from beer to rent. --BBC--
