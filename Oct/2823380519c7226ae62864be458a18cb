Woods carded a final-round three-under 67 for a three-stroke victory over home favourite Hideki Matsuyama after play spilt over into Monday after Friday was washed out. Woods had been one victory short of Snead since winning his 15th major at the Masters in April and had not played for nine weeks after having left knee surgery in August. World number 14 Tony Finau, who was also in the field in Japan, called Woods a "Living legend!" on Twitter. "Congrats on number 82 @TigerWoods!" he added as social media lit up on the news of yet another career comeback milestone. PGA Tour boss Jay Monahan was watching from home in the US and told AFP by phone: "It's just one of those 'wow' moments. When you see something happen in sport that you didn't think was possible, it's just a really historic and special moment for our sport." World number two Rory McIlroy who tied third, a distant six strokes behind Woods, said he'd quickly done the maths and said he would have to win "six times a year for the next 10 years" to get close to Woods. US Open champion Gary Woodland had a front-row seat as Woods' playing partner for the last two rounds and said it had been a privilege to watch. "I think it's a lot harder to win week-in and week-out out here, " he said. "Obviously the majors speak for themselves, but 82's just a crazy number. You look at the guys that have won 10 times and it's pretty special. "To battle through the injuries he's dealt with, gosh, he's young and he's playing unbelievable. I think there's a lot more in store."Â
