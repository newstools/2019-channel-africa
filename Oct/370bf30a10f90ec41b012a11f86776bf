The South African newspaper Sunday World reported over the weekend that Mantashe had bribed two of its journalists not to write a story about an alleged affair with a student – allegations he has since denied. The Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) has called on Mantashe to step down, saying its own research has concluded that the allegations are true. The Democratic Alliance (DA) has asked Parliament’s Joint Committee on Ethics and Members’ Interests to probe his conduct. The DA says Mantashe’s alleged actions are in violation of the code of ethical conduct. The party’s Shadow Minister of Mineral Resources and Energy Kevin Mileham says: “Members of Parliament and I would argue more specifically a minister, who should be held to a higher standard of accountability, are expected to act in the public interest and to maintain the trust and confidence of the public in the integrity of Parliament. It is our belief that Mantashe has failed to do so.” Meanwhile, Mantashe has denied the allegations. ANC National Spokesperson Pule Mabe says it refutes reports of bribery against its National Spokesperson, adding that the party respects and upholds press freedom and the work of journalists. Mantashe given seven days to clarify statement The South African National Editors Forum (Sanef) says it will write to President Cyril Ramaphosa about the bribery allegations levelled against Minister Mantashe. Sanef has given Mantashe seven days to clarify.
