The sale, which Takeda said in a statement is expected to close in the quarter ending March, comes as Japanâ€™s biggest drug maker looks to trim its debt following the $59 billion purchase of Shire. Takeda gained global heft through the Shire acquisition but left it highly indebted. It has pledged to shed non-core assets while focusing on five key areas; oncology, gastro-enterology, neuroscience, rare disease, and plasma-derived therapies. Takeda said it will continue to manufacture the drugs for Acino, which is backed by Avista Capital and Nordic Capital. --Reuters--
