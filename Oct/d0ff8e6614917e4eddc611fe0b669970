The armed forces of the Libyan government in Tripoli and their rivals from the self-proclaimed Libyan National Army headed by Gen Khalifa Haftar have been fighting in and around the Libyan capital, Tripoli, since April. The conflict started after an attack was launched by forces loyal to Gen Haftar in a bid to control the capital. Amnesty International says its team’s investigation included an examination of 33 strikes and their impact in and around Tripoli, which "revealed a systematic disregard for international law". The international watchdog cited several examples of civilians indiscriminately killed by ground rockets and artillery on the streets of densely populated areas by both warring parties. Gen Haftar’s forces have also targeted the capital’s only functioning airport several times, forcing it to shut down. Amnesty International also criticised government forces for sometimes using "field hospitals and medical facilities for military purposes" which exposed medical workers to deadly attacks by their rivals. Neither side has responded to the claims in this new report.
