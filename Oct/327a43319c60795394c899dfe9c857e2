His spokesperson said the 95-year-old had been taken to a top private hospital in the capital, Nairobi, for a "routine check-up". "It is prudent and advisable that everybody should go for medical check-up, so Mzee Moi went for a medical check-up," Moi's Press Secretary, Lee Njiru, is quoted by the paper as saying. The Daily Nation, quoting a family source, also reports that Moi was rushed to the hospital on Saturday after developing "breathing complications." The information was however denied by another family member, it adds. The former president ruled Kenya for 24 years between 1978 and 2002. --BBC--
