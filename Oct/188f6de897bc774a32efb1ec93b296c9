The South Korean automakers filed three lawsuits on Monday accusing BNSF, CSX Corp (CSX.O), Norfolk Southern Corp (NSCN) and Union Pacific Corp (UNP.N) of imposing the surcharges between July 2003 and December 2008. BNSF is a unit of billionaire Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway Inc (BRKa.N), but was a standalone company at the time of the alleged conspiracy. The lawsuits seek triple damages and were filed in the federal court in Santa Ana, California, near the automakers’ respective US headquarters. Lawyers for BNSF referred a request for comment to that company, which did not immediately respond. The other railroads’ lawyers did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Citing meetings, phone calls and emails, Hyundai and Kia accused the railroads of conspiring to impose fuel surcharges, under the guise of a fuel cost recovery program, that ultimately generated billions of dollars in profit at customers’ expense.
