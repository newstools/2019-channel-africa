It follows recent measles and rubella outbreaks that spread to more than 60 districts. The drive is co-funded by Gavi (the global vaccine alliance), Unicef and the World Health Organisation (WHO) and the Ugandan government. Polio has remained a big threat in Uganda with wild and vaccine-derived strains circulating in neighbouring Democratic Republic of Congo and South Sudan. Uganda has also seen a decline in routine vaccination programmes in recent years, the WHO says. In a joint statement, Uganda's health ministry and WHO said that the campaign will be a launchpad to introduce the measles-rubella vaccine into the countryâ€™s routine immunisation schedule. Disease surveillance is to begin as well as investigation of any suspected cases of these diseases. --BBC--
