Leonard Akwilapo, the countryâ€™s permanent secretary for education, said the test would be offered by the University of Dar es Salaam's Institute of Swahili Studies. The test is modelled around international proficiency tests for languages such as English, Spanish, Chinese and Arabic and will be offered from January. With Swahili recently adopted as the fourth official language of the Southern African Development Community, its proficiency should, therefore, be "authenticated", Akwilapo was quoted by the government-owned Daily News. The institute would be conducting six examinations annually in examination centres worldwide, targeting candidates seeking to use Swahili as their second or foreign language. Swahili is widely spoken across East Africa and parts of central Africa. Last year, South Africa announced it would be taught in schools as an optional subject by 2020.
