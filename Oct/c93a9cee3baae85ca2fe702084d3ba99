The company said in a statement the closure was due to technical problems which resulted in reduced ore production at the Skorpion site.
Skorpion expected to produce around 90 000 tons of zinc last year, according to Vedanta’s website. The global zinc market is around 14 million tons a year. Benchmark zinc on the London Metal Exchange was up 3.7% at $2,375 a ton at 1543 GMT, outperforming other industrial metals.
