Hundreds of people, mainly children, have died after being poisoned by the high levels of lead in the gold ore. The pilot project, conducted by Médecins Sans Frontières and Occupational Knowledge International, involved spraying water at ore processing sites to reduce the amount of lead in the air. Miners were also trained to reduce exposure by eating in areas away from the mines, changing clothes and washing themselves after work.  --BBC--
