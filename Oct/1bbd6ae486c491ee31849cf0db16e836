Investors sold off Ford shares, which fell 2.5% to $8.98 in after-hours trading while shares in electric car maker Tesla Inc (TSLA.O) surged more than 20% on better than expected results. In a conference call with analysts, Hackett said Ford “experienced more headwinds” than expected in the quarter. “As a result, we will not grow adjusted EBIT this year as we intended,” Hackett said, referring to earnings before interest and taxes. The disappointing financial results are a setback for Hackett, the former Chief Executive Officer of office furniture maker, Steelcase, who took over Ford in May 2017 after the abrupt ouster of Ford veteran Mark Fields. For two years, Hackett has been asking investors to be patient with a methodical restructuring that has made progress, including a wide-ranging alliance on electric vehicles with Volkswagen AG and the sale of money-losing operations in India to a venture controlled by Indian automaker Mahindra & Mahindra. But by Ford’s own reckoning, most of the restructuring work has yet to be done. It has booked only $3.3 billion of the projected $11 billion in charges it previously said it would take for the global restructuring, up from $2.2 billion at the end of the second quarter.
