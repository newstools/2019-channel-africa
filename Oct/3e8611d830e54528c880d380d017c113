Microsoft said it expected “intelligent cloud” revenue of $11.25 billion to $11.45 billion for its fiscal second quarter, above analysts’ consensus of $11.2 billion, IBES data from Refinitiv showed. Revenue from Azure grew 59% in the fiscal first quarter ended Sept. 30, well below the 76% in the year-ago period and slightly short of analysts’ estimates. Microsoft also expects “double-digit” percentage growth in both revenue and operating income for its fiscal 2020, company executives said on a conference call. “The guidance is strong,” said Mark Moerdler, managing director of global software and senior analyst with Bernstein. “There were a number of people surprised that their numbers were so good for the full year.” The results sent Microsoft shares, which were up 34% for the year before the report, up 0.45% to $137.86 in after-market trading.
