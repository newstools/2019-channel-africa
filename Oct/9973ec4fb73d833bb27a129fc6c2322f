The minister on Friday briefed media on the funding allocation to the national broadcaster, which recently reported a loss of $31.7 million for the year ended March 31, 2019. The SABC has sought a $210 million cash injection from Treasury, but has had to meet eight preconditions before any approval can be granted. The SABC has only met five of the eight conditions. Two of the preconditions have been partially met and one has not been met at all. Treasury has agreed to allocate $138 million to the broadcaster. The remaining $72 000 will be approved when the other conditions are met, Ndabeni-Abrahams said. "It is noted that the SABC turnaround requires more than the $138 million short-term funding," Ndabeni- Abrahams added. "The Department of Communications will further continue engaging with National Treasury to source funding through the normal medium-term expenditure framework processes," she said. --News24--
