Buhari is in the country on a State visit which also coincides with the 20th anniversary of the South Africa-Nigeria Bi-National Commission. The Commission seeks to strengthen economic and political relations. President Ramaphosa has used the occasion to assure his Nigerian counterpart that the country is determined to stop such incidents in future. Buhari says attacks on foreign nationals in South Africa undermine relations with other African countries. He says his government has taken action to prevent a repeat of retaliatory attacks on SA businesses in his country and he has called on the Ramaphosa administration to ensure such attacks do not take place again. --SABC--
