Freight rates have soared as oil producers scramble for non-blacklisted vessels, discouraging longer-distance voyages. Complex refining margins for advanced facilities capabl  e of extracting even more valuable products like diesel and gasoline, have been especially strong in Europe, industry sources said. The US sanctions have had a particularly heavy impact on the cost of hiring very large crude carriers (VLCCs), those most commonly used on long-haul journeys. “As a result, refiners and traders, will look to buy regional grades, ideally with dedicated vessels,” a report by the Oxford Institute for Energy Studies said. Smaller tankers such as the Aframax, used more commonly within the Atlantic basin, offer a relatively better deal. “High freight rates for crude are keeping crude in the Atlantic basin relatively cheap,” a crude trader said. Freight rates for shipping West African oil to Europe have eased, from world scale 275 to 230 according to a European importer, making it a more attractive destination than markets in the Americas and Asia.
