The IOC last week announced a plan to move the marathon and race walking events to Sapporo, on Japan's northern island of Hokkaido, due to concerns about heat in Tokyo next summer. Taro Shirato, a member of the Tokyo Metropolitan Assembly, told a news conference that the IOC's decision is not the best for the athletes, who had been prepared for the marathon course in Tokyo. The IOC's John Coates met Tokyo Governor, Yuriko Koike, on Friday, where he told that the decision was made after the athletics world championship in Doha, which failed spectacularly, with over 40% of competitors dropping out of the women's marathon. The Tokyo Olympics run from July 24-August 9, a period when the Japanese capital struggles with high heat and humidity. When Tokyo last hosted the Summer Games in 1964 they were held in October to avoid the heat. --Reuters--
