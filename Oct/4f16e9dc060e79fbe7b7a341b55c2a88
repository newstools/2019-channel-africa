Armed assailants seized the six students, school vice principal and matron in a dawn raid on their mixed boarding school on October 3. "The students and staff of the Engravers College who were abducted have regained their freedom ," Samuel Aruwan, Kaduna state internal security and home affairs commissioner said in a short statement. Aruwan did not say how the kidnapped students had been released or if a ransom had been paid. Kaduna state governor, Mallam Nasir El-Rufai, told reporters days after the abduction that the kidnappers had made contact demanding ransom payment. Although the governor declined to give details of those demands, some parents of the hostages said the abductors had demanded $140 000 for the release of their daughters.
