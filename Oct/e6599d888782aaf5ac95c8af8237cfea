H&M has been spending heavily on reviving its business after years of falling profits and growing inventories due to slowing sales at its core H&M branded stores. Shares in H&M, which is controlled by the founding Persson family, with the founder’s son the chairman and his grandson the CEO, were up 6.5% at 1040 GMT. “H&M delivered its first strong quarterly earnings in over four years, which could raise confidence in the turnaround,” investment bank Carnegie said in research note. After hitting a 13-year low in 2018, the shares have soared 56% this year on hopes H&M is starting to get back on track, though they remain at about half their peak levels hit in 2015.
