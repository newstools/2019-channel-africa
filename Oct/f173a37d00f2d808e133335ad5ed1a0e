They had been sent to block him from leaving the property for a concert he had organised to coincide with Uganda’s Independence Day. Despite the blockade, Bobi Wine managed to elude them and later got on a motorbike to another venue where he addressed a press conference. A video of the opposition politician jumping onto a moving motorbike to avoid arrest has been widely shared on social media. "We relaxed the security yesterday after we realized that the chance of Bobi Wine moving forward with the unauthorized concert was low. That is how he managed to move out and be in the city centre," Kampala Metropolitan Police spokesperson Patrick Onyango told the BBC. He said the concert was cancelled because the pop star had not met health and safety standards. “He didn’t fulfil concert guidelines on the medical care plan, the traffic control plan, fire fighting equipment plan and crowd control, how many stewards was he supposed to provide to police to help in providing security?” Bobi Wine told journalists on Wednesday that the police have now cancelled 156 of his concerts. --BBC--
