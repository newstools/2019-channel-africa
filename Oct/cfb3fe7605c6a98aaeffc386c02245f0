This is according to a written reply to Members of Parliament from Communications Minister Stella Ndabeni-Abrahams, who was responding to a question fromÂ Economic Freedom Fighters Member of Parliament, Lehlohonolo Mokoena. Mokoena asked how much progress, if any, had been made in transforming Postbank into a fully-fledged bank since the enactment of the Financial Matters Amendment Bill. The journey to have Postbank operates as a fully-fledged bank started, in earnest, when President Cyril Ramaphosa signed the Financial Matters Amendment Bill into law this year. Since then, Postbank was taken from being a division of the Post Office and transferred to a holding entity, namely "South African Postbank". Ndabeni-Abrahams said all the Reserve Bank requirements pertaining to the banking licence application process for Postbank had been fully met, except for one. "This is the requirement to apply to register the bank controlling company with the Registrar of Banks in terms of Section 43 of the Banks Act."
