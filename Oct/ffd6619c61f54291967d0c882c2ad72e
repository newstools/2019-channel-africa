United manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer switched to a 3-5-2 formation that restricted the league leaders to precious few chances.

With Klopp angered by the VAR decision not to rule out Rashford's goal for a foul on Divock Origi by Victor Lindelof in the build-up. "When we come here this year, last year and the year before they just defend. It's not criticism, it's just a fact," added Klopp. "The quality they have, (when they) set up like that, it's really difficult. It's no excuse, we needed to do better. We are a good team and it's normal people think about how they stop us." Mourinho, working as a studio pundit for Sky Sports at Old Trafford, immediately hit back at Klopp's complaint by pointing to the German's failure to yet claim a win at Old Trafford. "That's because he didn't beat Man United at Old Trafford. He didn't like the menu. He wanted meat and got fish," Mourinho retorted.
