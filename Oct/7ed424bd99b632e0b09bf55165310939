Almost 2 700 households are affected in South Africa. Eskom says its increasingly disconnecting non-paying customers across Gauteng, and it will be extended to other areas. Earlier this week, the residents of Lakeside Extension 2 violently stopped Eskom operations of conducting audits and disconnections in the area, said Motlhabane Ramashi, senior Eskom manager for maintenance and operations in Gauteng. “Eskom employees were chased out of the area while they were busy with their duties consequently compromising their safety and the integrity of the network.” 

Eskom added that Orange Farm is one of the areas that has a high rate of non-payment and non-buying of electricity. "These measures have been put in place to ensure that the services we render are paid for by all customers, and to ascertain our sustainability as a business.”
