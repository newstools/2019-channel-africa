With a heavy reliance on box kicking, set piece and defence, the Springboks have not always been the most attractive side to watch at the 2019 showpiece when it comes to attacking, running rugby. Scrumhalf Faf de Klerk, in particular, has come in for some flak over the last two weeks with him central to the Bok kicking game in both the quarter-final win over Japan and this past weekend's semi-final triumph against Wales. Now, as the Boks look to secure their third World Cup crown against a heavily-fancied English outfit, coach Rassie Erasmus must find a way to get the job done once more. Once more, it is unlikely to be pretty. Erasmus was asked on Tuesday what he made of suggestions that the Boks were playing "boring" rugby at the tournament. "If one understands where we’ve been coming from, being number six, seven or eight in the world, we’ve got certain challenges, and one of them was always to redeem ourselves and become a power again in world rugby, and try to get to number one and two," the coach explained.
