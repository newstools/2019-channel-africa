Chinese officials have doubts about whether it is possible to reach a comprehensive long-term trade deal with Washington and United States President Donald Trump, Bloomberg reported earlier in the day. “This headline news (on trade) is giving investors a reason to take some profits off the table,” said Peter Cardillo, chief market economist at Spartan Capital Securities in New York. The tariff war between the world’s two biggest economies has disrupted supply chains and roiled financial markets for more than a year. The trade-sensitive industrials sector .SPLRCI dropped 0.86%. Chipmakers, which have a sizable exposure to China, also fell, with the Philadelphia Semiconductor index .SOX slipping 1.44%. However, corporate earnings were a bright spot. Apple Inc (AAPL.O) rose 1.5% after the iPhone maker forecast sales for the holiday shopping quarter ahead of expectations.
