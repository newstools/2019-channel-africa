A look towards Zimbabwe and the wider Southern African region shows why. Increasingly severe weather events have racked the lands and people. Only this year, one of the worst ever cyclones to hit the Southern Hemisphere and severe flooding have wrought devastation across the region. Then there was no water: the severest drought since 1981 has taken hold, decimating crops and leading to widespread food insecurity. In the midst of ecological crises, the new Zimbabwean Government is looking to restore balance to our international relations: we want to end the 20-year isolation under our predecessor. It is clear that major challenges facing humanity require concerted international co-operation, and Zimbabwe is keen to play its part. Key among those platforms for global collaboration is the Commonwealth. We seek Kenya’s support for Zimbabwe’s application to re-join. Kenya is the current Chair of the Commonwealth Ministerial Action Group, the organisation’s leading decision-making body, and the process of readmission is already underway. Last month saw Commonwealth Secretary-General Patricia Scotland meet Zimbabwe’s President Emmerson Mnangagwa to discuss its progress. After talks, she underlined that the step-by- step procedure is being accelerated as quickly as possible, stating there are “a number of areas where Zimbabwe has made real reforms”. With Commonwealth support, we believe the new Government’s reform programme can be delivered faster and with greater durability. The 53-country club of nations provides opportunities for collaboration and the sharing of experience and best practice, helping governments to improve the lives of their citizens. --Herald--
