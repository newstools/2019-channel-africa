The company had been banned from exporting materials and was hit with a huge tax bill. As part of the settlement it will give the government a shareholding in its mines and half of all royalties. The agreement is a breakthrough for both Barrick and Tanzania following three years of dispute that saw each side losing millions of dollars in earnings. As part of the deal, which awaits approval by Tanzania's attorney general, the two sides have formed a company, Twiga Minerals, which will manage three mines previously owned by Barrick. Barrick has agreed to give Tanzania a 16% shareholding in the mines, half of the mines' royalties. Relations between Tanzania and Barrick soured in 2017 after President John Magufuli launched what he called an "economic war" against foreign mining companies which he accused of not paying sufficient taxes and royalties. The crackdown saw the export of Barrickâ€™s concentrates halted. The company was also hit with a $190 billion what Tanzanian authorities said were unpaid taxes, penalties and interest accumulated in previous years. In terms of the agreement, the company will pay $300 million to settle all outstanding taxes. --BBC--
