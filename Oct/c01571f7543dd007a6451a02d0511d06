The coach has recalled Europe-based sextet of Pape Djibril Diaw, Racine Coly, Sidy Sarr, Mamadou Loum Ndiaye, Famara Diédhiou and Habib Diallo for the first ever clash between both nations on October 10. Cisse has omitted six experienced internationals from the squad that lost the Africa Cup of Nations final to Algeria in July. Youssouf Sabaly, Moussa Konaté, Pape Abou Cissé, Henri Saivet, Alfred Ndiaye and Mbaye Diagne have all been left out. "The choice of this 23-man squad is to prepare for the future, while keeping a core balance of the team," Cisse said. "Our ambition is to win but the major satisfaction that matters the most is that Senegal will play against a top ranked nation, and the players will compete against quality players." Liverpool's Sadio Mane and Napoli's Kalidou Koulibaly lead a cast of established notable stars including France-based Idrissa Gana Gueye and Watford's Ismaila Sarr. It will be the Teranga Lions' first game since losing the Nations Cup final to Algeria in Egypt. The game is a build-up match for the continent's top-ranked side as they prepare for the 2021 Africa Cup of Nations qualifying campaign beginning in November. Senegal will feature in Group I alongside Congo Brazzaville, Guinea-Bissau and eSwatini. --BBC--
