The central bank is widely expected to cut interest rates for the third time this year to counter any fallout from a protracted US-China trade war on the domestic economy. After a modestly higher open, US stocks slipped into the red. The interest rate sensitive banking sub-sector .SPXBK shed 0.6%. Five of the 11 major S&P 500 sectors were lower, with losses in the financial sector .SPSY weighing the most. The Fed decision is due at 2 p.m. ET followed by a press conference from Chair Jerome Powell. Traders have fully priced in a quarter percentage point rate cut, up from a nearly 40% chance a month earlier. Hopes of a rate cut and optimism around trade talks had pushed the benchmark S&P 500 to record highs in the last two sessions. “Certainly a rate cut is widely factored in,” said Scott Brown, chief economist at Raymond James in St. Petersburg, Florida. “Most people are looking for some sort of a hint that this will likely be it for a while.” A Commerce Department report showed U.S. economic growth slowed less than expected in the third quarter as declining business investment was offset by resilient consumer spending and a rebound in exports, further allaying financial market fears of a recession.
