The court’s ruling, which was released on Tuesday, adds to pressure on the East African nation, which faces at least two other multi-million claims from international investors. The case stems from a legal battle between the Tanzanian government and privately-owned independent power producer IPTL, which led to the dismissal of several cabinet ministers in 2014. The award by the World Bank’s International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes is less than the $352.5 million sought by Standard Chartered Bank Hong Kong, which was not immediately available for comment. The government of Tanzania denied any responsibility and said it was not planning to pay the damages. “Neither the government nor (state power company) TANESCO, have a legal liability in these cases,” Tanzania government spokesperson Hassan Abbasi said on Twitter on Wednesday.
