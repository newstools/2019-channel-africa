The country was placed eighth in its list of top tourist destinations. Lonely Planet, which produces a series of popular guide books, also named two other African countries in its top 10, Eswatini (placed fifth) and Morocco (ninth). If the Lonely Planet ranking did have an impact it would be a remarkable turnaround for a country that was cut off from visitors during the Ebola outbreak that ended in 2016. Lonely Planet called Eswatini "one of Southern Africaâ€™s most underrated destinations" and Morocco has "time-honoured attractions complemented by sustainable-yet-stylish lodging". It has been a good few days for Liberia when it comes to top 10 lists. Last week, it was named as the most welcoming country for strangers in the world by the Charities Aid Foundation.
