France tried to set up a meeting between the leaders of Iran and the US after the attack, but the move failed because Tehran wants Washington to remove its sanctions, Putin said at an energy conference in Moscow.

Iran denied any involvement and vowed to retaliate against even a limited military response. 

It has criticised the accusation as part of a campaign of “maximum pressure” launched by President Donald Trump on Tehran after he quit a 2015 nuclear pact last year and widened sanctions to choke off Iran’s oil exports.
