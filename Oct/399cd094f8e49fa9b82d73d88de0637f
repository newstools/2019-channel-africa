Paris St Germainâ€™s Mbappe, who has been struggling with a recurring thigh problem, has been replaced in the squad by Borussia Moenchengladbach forward Alassane Plea. France travel to Iceland in Group H on Friday before hosting Turkey at the Stade de France on Monday. The world champions are second in Group H on 15 points, behind Turkey by virtue of their defeat in Konya last June, while Iceland is third with 12 points after six matches. --Reuters--
