Back in the Springbok team for Saturday's Rugby World Cup final against England after missing the 19-16 semi-final win over Wales with an ankle injury, Kolbe said he was instead primed for an aerial battle in Yokohama. Team-mate Faf de Klerk dominated proceedings against Wales, as the two sides kicked the ball an incredible 81 times over the 80 minutes, deploying a kicking game backed by a pressing, aggressive defence that tries to force opposition errors. "I obviously do enjoy running with ball in hand, but the game has really differed in the last couple of months in terms of being more aerial, battle-wise," said Kolbe. "I think there's going to be a bit of a contest in the air and chasing and I think that the team that's going to be up for that is the team that's going to pull it through." While De Klerk and Handre Pollard pull the halfback strings for South Africa, with fullback Willie Le Roux also offering a kicking option, England's Owen Farrell, George Ford and Elliot Daly all have an equally impressive kicking game. "There are structures, plans put in place," continued Kolbe, who said he was looking forward to coming up against Jonny May - "He has got a lot of wheels!" "If you wear that jersey, it's whatever it takes to wear it and give the best on the field, whether it's chasing up on a kick, on defence or running with the ball in hand.
