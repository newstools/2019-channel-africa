De Klerk has been one of the stand-out players at this World Cup, his shock of blond hair and diminutive stature setting him apart in a game of giants. He is the player every team would want: a combative, livewire presence who corals his towering forwards, also offering a precise kicking game and service on a platter to fly-half Handre Pollard. Davies has proven himself as poacher supreme, one intercept off Will Genia leading to a crucial try in the pool victory over Australia. "He has scored a few tries from intercepts," de Klerk says of Davies. "He is more there to disrupt the attack and get in between the nine and the first forwards, or nine and ten in the second pod. "We are aware of it, and we know he does it very well, he's got great speed off the line. We are going to have to be awake on that." As the Prince of Wales told the Welsh players when he visited them at training this week, the Springboks are "bloody big buggers". The lock pairing of Eben Etzebeth and Lood de Jager form a prime example of that, more than filling the enforcer role so long held by the likes of Victor Matfield and Bakkies Botha. Etzebeth might face charges of racial abuse, but that has not stopped him performing in Japan, the lynchpin of a Bok pack that will undoubtedly go toe-to-toe with Wales.
