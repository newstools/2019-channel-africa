The move is part of the recommendations by the World Bank to boost liquidity in the stock market where nearly 90 % of the 1.6 million share accounts are dormant and have not been actively trading in the past two years, according to data Central Depository and Settlement Corporation Ltd. Analysts say the move that has also seen capital markets regulators cut the stock settlement cycle to within 24 hours from the previous three days’ period is meant to spur trading on the Nairobi bourse that have seen its daily turnover decline by more than 40 % to as low as $3.61 million from $6.08 million in the last 10 months (January 16 to October 16, 2019) according to data from the NSE. “This is a very good move for the market. Investors have always made money when they buy shares and sell them off when their prices go up. However, we have now opened up an opportunity for investors to make money when prices of shares decline,” said Paul Mwai, chief executive, AIB Capital Ltd. “This type of trade is largely for informed investors who have a very good understanding of the market and who have analysed company shares. They will have to speculate by trying as much as possible to make accurate predictions on share prices for them to realise short-term gains.” According to Mwai opening up the market to more speculators will improve liquidity and enhance transparency and pricing in the market. So far trading on the NSE is dominated by five companies (Safaricom, Equity Bank, East African Breweries Ltd, KCB and Co-operative Bank) which account for more than 70 % of the market capitalisation. Last week the NSE officially launched a new trading system that allows for Short Selling and Day Trading with hopes of injecting a new lease of life into a stock market that is struggling to attract new companies and that has suffered massive exit of retail investors. --TheEastAfrican--
