“There was a huge increase in production leading to a supply of about 200 million kilogrammes. This had an impact on the global prices and has resulted in reduced income for our factories,” said Lerionka Tiampati, Kenya Tea Development Agency (KTDA) managing director. During the year, global tea production stood at 5.8 billion kilogrammes against a demand of 5.6 billion kilogrammes, resulting in a 200 million kilogrammes surplus. KTDA said last week on Thursday that income for the year ended June stood at $7.1 billion compared with $8.8 billion the previous year. Farmers will therefore get paid $41.2 per kilogramme of delivered green leaf, down from $52.8 per kilogramme last year. The decline in earnings was felt across the region and prices averaged $2 per kilogramme for the five EAC countries at the Mombasa tea auction. This represented a significant decline from $3 per kilogramme last year. Rwanda’s tea attracted the best price of $2.68 followed by Kenya at $2.59, Burundi $2.21, Tanzania $1.36 and Uganda $1.21. --TheEastAfrican--
