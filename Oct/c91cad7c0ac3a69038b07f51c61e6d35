"We think this order issued by the federal ministry of interior is against the law and the constitution," Jubaland Information Minister Abdi Hussein Sheikh Mohamed told BBC Somali. Jubbaland is one of Somalia's six semi- autonomous regional states. President Ahmed Madobe, who has been in charge of Jubaland since 2013, won a fourth term in August in an election that was dismissed by the federal government, which is based in the capital, Mogadishu. It said that the August election was a “failure” and "corrupt" and that it had violated both the federal and the regional constitution. It is unclear how the federal government will carry out elections in Jubaland as it does not seem to have any influence in Kismayo, the temporary seat of the regional government. The dispute between the two sides escalated recently after Jubaland's authorities ignored an order from the federal government that all flights to Kismayo should go through Mogadishu. --BBC--
