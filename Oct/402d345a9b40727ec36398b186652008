The tournament set to be played in China between 17 June and 4 July, with an expanded 24 teams, the Club World Cup's new timing and format both pose problems for Africa's showpiece event. The next Afcon finals are scheduled for June to July 2021 in Cameroon, although there's a possibility they could be played solely in July. "Fifa's decision that June is a good time to host the Club World Cup means they are killing the Nations Cup," Togo coach LeRoy told BBC Sport Africa. "When they decided to make a world championship of clubs with 24 teams at the same time as the Africa Cup of Nations, it's terrible for the projection of this beautiful competition - the Nations Cup," he added. Frenchman LeRoy has coached at a record nine Nations Cups, winning the tournament with Cameroon in 1988.
