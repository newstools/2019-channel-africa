MyBroadband first reported on Sunday that a number of Internet service providers, including Afrihost, Axxess and Webafrica, were affected. WebAfrica said in a statement on its website that it had been experiencing a "large scale volumetric DDoS [distributed denial-of-service] attack from international sources [at] +50Gbps." DDoS attacks occur when online services are flooded with too much traffic in an attempt to crash them. The attacks come a few days after SA banks were subjected to DDoS attacks. The City of Johannesburg shut down its services last week after it also came under attack. The hackers reportedly demand the payment of 4.0 bitcoins by October 28 at 17:00 failing which they will upload the entire city's data on to the internet. Afrihost, in a statement on its website, said it had "mitigated the current volumetric DDoS attack which started again this [Monday] morning".
