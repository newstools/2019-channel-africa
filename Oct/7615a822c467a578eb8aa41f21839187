Speaking at the opening address of the Financial Times Africa Summit in London on Monday - a gathering of investors, business people and decision makers - Ramaphosa said the free trade plan would develop a single market of 54 nations, with 1.2 billion people and a combined GDP of $3 trillion. Ramaphosa spoke of investment opportunities in Africa, which he said were being enhanced by the African Continental Free Trade Agreement. 

He said the agreement was the realisation of the dreams of the founders of the African Union, 56 years ago, comparing it to the Maastricht Treaty of 1992, which represented a new era of integration in Europe.   

Ramaphosa also said Africa would learn lessons from the EU. "We have been learning from others in the past and we will learn from the mistakes they continue to make, as they undo [those of] the EU and a few others," Ramaphosa said. "We want to learn from what they are doing and not doing correctly. I want to assure you, our union will be much more durable than what we can see around [us]," Ramaphosa said. His comment was met with chuckles from the crowd present. The EU and UK are currently engaged in talks for the latter to leave the union.
