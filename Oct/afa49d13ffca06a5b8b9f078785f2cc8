A mega-rich Middle East consortium proposed a potential takeover offer but it was shrugged off by the Russian, according to The Telegraph, via The Sun. There have been rumours that the billionaire businessman was looking to sell since the UK tightened its regulations on visas for wealthy foreign nationals. Abramovich is now rarely seen at Stamford Bridge and has put plans to develop the stadium on hold, sparking rumours he is losing interest in the West London club. It is claimed that Abramovich has been approached by a number of potential buyers including Sir Jim Ratcliffe, once Britain’s richest man. Sources close to Abramovich insist it is "not for sale" but The Telegraph report also claims that the Russian would consider entertaining offers if he receives a bid in the region of £3 billion ($3.86 billion).
