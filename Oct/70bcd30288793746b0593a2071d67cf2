The video clip opens with a scene of a wife welcoming her husband home and inviting him to eat dinner, only to be spat at and beaten up by him. "You are of no use in this house," he says. "Your belly is always full of beans, while other women’s bellies are full of babies." Nkurunziza, 49, then intervenes, walking into the childless couple’s sitting room. She strikes a conciliatory tone, explaining: "You only know for sure about infertility after seeing the doctor. "Infertility can happen to men or women." In the next scene, the first lady then breaks into song, dancing alongside other dancers and musicians. "Women are not created just to be called mothers. They are capable of much more," the chorus goes. --BBC--
