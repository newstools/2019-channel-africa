The deal came after the United States, the Kurds' main ally, said it would withdraw its remaining troops from northern Syria. Turkey began an offensive in the region last week, aiming to push Kurdish forces from the border region. Areas under the control of the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) came under heavy bombardment over the weekend, with Turkey making gains in two key border towns. Dozens of civilians and fighters have been killed on both sides. The US announced on Sunday it was preparing to evacuate its 1000 remaining soldiers from northern Syria.  

The Turkish offensive and US withdrawal have drawn an international outcry, as the SDF were the main allies of the West in the battle against the Islamic State (IS) group in Syria.
