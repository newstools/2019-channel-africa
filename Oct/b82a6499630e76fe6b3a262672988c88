Vaz said the decision, which was read out on national radio, was based on what he called a "serious political crisis" in the country, which had "prevented the normal operation of some institutions". The move comes days after Prime Minister Aristide Gomes denounced a coup attempt and police violently repressed an opposition protest. One protester was killed on Saturday and several others were injured during a demonstration calling for a delay to the 24 November election. The opposition wants the election delayed to give it time to clean up the election register to prevent voter fraud.  Vaz, 62, has been in office since 2014 after he won a tight presidential contest that was decided in a run-off. Analysts saw his win as a new start for a country that had known only coups and turmoil since the end of Portuguese rule in 1974. Vaz's time in office has, however, seen a series of prime ministers come and go. The 2015 sacking of then-Prime Minister Domingos Simões Pereira is believed to have sparked the current crisis. Vaz's term in office ended on 23 June but he is staying on temporarily under a plan mediated by the regional bloc Ecowas. He will contest the next election as an independent candidate, along with 11 other candidate. --BBC--
