The National Credit Regulator’s second-quarter Credit Bureau monitor has revealed that consumers have debt amounting to R1.9 trillion as of June 2019. Experts believe that some of this debt has been offered recklessly without accessing consumer’s level of indebtedness. Many consumers are battling to cope with the high cost of living; soaring electricity, water, food, and transport costs are adding to the burden. Credit providers are capitalising on this by offering them credit that they cannot afford. Some consumers see this as a quick fix to deal with their financial problems and do not scrutinise the interest they are being charged. Octogen Financial Services Director, Paul Slot says consumers are living beyond their means.   “There is no question that those consumers are living beyond their means and there is a belief that one additional loan would solve their problems.” According to recent research conducted by Financial service company Octogen, consumers spend about 63% of their after-tax income to service debt and spend only 5% on financial services such as insurance and medical aid. 32% of their income goes to household expenditures such as groceries and transport.
