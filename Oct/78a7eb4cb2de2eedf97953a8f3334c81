Hamilton criticised Mercedes’ strategy at Suzuka as, mimicking his team-mate’s two-stop strategy, which meant as a result he was unable to fight Valtteri Bottas for the win. Bottas was the first of the Mercedes’ pairing to pit, relinquishing the lead to Hamilton but regaining it when his team-mate stopped. The Finn did so again later in the race, however, there was a brief moment of panic from Bottas’ side as he questioned whether Hamilton would in fact stop again. Mercedes said he would, and he did. Hamilton, though, reckons if he could have run a one-stopper and challenged for the win had Mercedes given him “better guidance.” Wolff says he has issue with his driver’s complaints. “No there’s nothing [to it],” the motorsport boss told Channel 4 on Sunday evening. “All the good drivers are annoyed when they can’t win so it is completely normal. “It happened at the start, Valtteri was in the lead and Lewis was third or fourth and this was when the race was decided.” As for Bottas, the Finn clinched his first grand prix win since April with Wolff saying he drove a perfect race.
