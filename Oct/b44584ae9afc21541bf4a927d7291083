Prosecutor say investigations are not complete. Two weeks ago, Kabendera's lawyers, from the Tanzania Human Right Defenders Coalition, told a court in Dar es Salaam that their client had written to the countryâ€™s public prosecutor to initiate a plea bargain. Kabendera, a top investigative journalist who has written for many international media including the United Kingdom's Guardian newspaper, is facing charges of money laundering, tax evasion and leading a criminal organisation. His lawyers have denied the charges, saying they are politically motivated. His case has attracted international attention and government critics say his arrest is an example of the shrinking space for media freedom of expression in the country. The government has dismissed the allegations. --BBC--
