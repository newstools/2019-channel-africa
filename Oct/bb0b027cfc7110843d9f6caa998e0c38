Based on data from almost 2 500 polling stations out of a total of more than 20 000, the the Electoral Institute for Sustainable Democracy in Africa (EISA) estimates Nyusi will win 70.9% of the vote. Though official results have yet to be announced, former guerrilla movement turned main opposition party Renamo has already rejected the outcome, decrying irregularities in the process from voter registration through to counting. Perceived fraud and an unhappy Renamo threaten a fragile peace accord signed just months ago between its presidential candidate, Ossufo Momade, and Nyusi. EISA Programme Officer, Domingos Rosario, said that during its count, the institute found that in many polling stations across seven different provinces, the number of votes greatly exceeded the number of voters registered at that station. The official count for the October 15 presidential, provincial and legislative poll, which will decide who controls a nation on the cusp of becoming a top global gas exporter, is still ongoing. A spokesperson for the Electoral Administration Technical Secretariat did not respond to multiple requests for comment.
