Organizers announced eight of the world's 10 top-ranked players among the first 16 in the field who will compete in the December 4-7 event at the Albany resort in the Bahamas. Two final players will be named later to complete the lineup for the event's fifth consecutive staging in the Bahamas, with a Saturday finish scheduled to help players travel to the Presidents Cup in Australia, where Woods will serve as captain for the American squad. The lineup will include third-ranked American Dustin Johnson, Spain's fourth-ranked Rahm, number five Rose of England and, in ranking order, Americans Patrick Cantlay, Justin Thomas, Bryson DeChambeau, Woods and Xander Schauffele. Also named to the field were Americans Woodland, Tony Finau, Webb Simpson, Patrick Reed, Rickie Fowler, Matt Kuchar, Bubba Watson and Kevin Kisner.
