A contraction of 0.6% means that the country is, once again, flirting with a recession, should the fourth quarter be similarly negative. The GDP numbers mirror the dismal unemployment figures and the broader issues of rising debt-to-GDP, falling business confidence sentiment and an ongoing battle to keep-the-lights-on, both literally at Eskom and figuratively among a host of ailing SOEs. More forgiving commentators have spoken about the carefully nurtured strategy of President Cyril Ramaphosa to incrementally direct reforms across a wide variety of governmental sectors.   

They point to the broad-based recovery of institutional integrity – particularly at the National Prosecution Authority (NPA), the Hawks, the South African Revenue Service and in the reconstitution of a host of SOE boards. 

A better governance ethic is apparent while the PR machine aimed at the investor community is gaining traction, albeit largely when flashy investor summits occur. Yet despite these not insignificant shifts, nothing from the past year seems to be having any direct impact on the performance of the domestic economy.    

While re-booting a state from an incapable status to one that is more capable can take many years thanks to the rot of malfeasance, time is of the essence for a country desperately in need of economic growth.
