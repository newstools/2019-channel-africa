Macron, along with Niger's President Mahamadou Issoufou, have also announced that a summit to discuss security issues in the Sahel area that was scheduled for Monday has been postponed to early next year. Tuesday's attack at a military base in Inates is thought to be the deadliest on soldiers in the country since 2015. Niger, Mauritania, Chad, Burkina Faso and Mali make up the G5 Sahel group established to combat jihadist violence in the region. French soldiers are deployed in the Sahel to support this effort. Last month 13 French soldiers died in Mali when two helicopters collided during an operation against jihadists there. --BBC--
