City are set to beat Manchester United and Liverpool to the 17-year-oldâ€™s signature after he excelled at the 2019 FIFA Under-17 World Cup in Brazil. The striker netted a hat-trick against Ecuador at the tournament and was also nominated for Goal of the Tournament at the global finals. He is currently at Dabo Babes Academy in his homeland, but is almost certain to move to Europe either in the January window or at the end of the season. --AllAfrica--
