The decision to postpone the event, which was to address French military presence in the region as well as the fight against so-called jihadist organisations, follows an attack on a remote military camp in Niger. Islamist militants killed 71 soldiers in an attack on a military camp located near the border with Mali, an army spokesman said on Wednesday, in the deadliest raid against the Nigerien military in living memory.
