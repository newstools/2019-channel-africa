The minister was answering to questions posed to him by members of Parliament on Tuesday; specifically, a question on De Ruyter's appointment. The new chief executive's appointment has been criticised by some unions and the EFF, with the latter emphasising the nosedive in the share price of Nampak – the packaging company of which De Ruyter is currently CEO – under his watch. African Christian Democratic Party MP Wayne Thring asked Gordhan to respond to criticisms levelled at De Ruyter because he is not an engineer and might not understand critical difficulties at the power utility; criticism alleging that he was not successful at Nampak; and criticism that he is white, making his appointment anti-transformational. 

Gordhan responded by first commending De Ruyter for being the "one person" willing to take a 20% cut on his salary. "In today's world, few people will do that," Gordhan added. De Ruyter also spent 20 years at Sasol, and has "massive experience" working with engineers, said Gordhan. "People worked with him at Nampak are highly complementary of his leadership," he said. Regarding Nampak's performance, Gordhan said he personally is not an expert on the company but knows that companies go through "rough patches" and that De Ruyter led the restructuring of Nampak.
