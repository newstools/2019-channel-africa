Rescuers have been recovering the bodies of victims swept to their deaths by the flash floods in the western Bundibugyo area, the aid group said. Homes have been washed away and a number of roads blocked or destroyed. Large parts of east Africa have suffered floods and landslides in recent weeks. Hundreds have died and millions have been displaced. The events have been linked to an unusual weather phenomenon in the Indian Ocean. Heavy rain has been battering the country for weeks, and intensified overnight on Friday into Saturday. Police, military, aid agencies and community members are assisting with search and rescue operations in more than a dozen affected areas. Rain is hampering communications in the locations in the remote west of the country, AFP news agency reported. The Red Cross said its volunteers continued to recover more bodies, including some trapped in cocoa trees in the Bundibugyo hills, describing the events as "devastating".
