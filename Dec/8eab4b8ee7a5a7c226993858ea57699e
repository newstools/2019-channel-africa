The floods covered the vegetation along the Pakwach road on the Pakwach-Arua highway, the Ugandan red cross tweeted. Rain-triggered disasters, including flash floods and landslides, have killed at least 250 people and affected some three million people across East Africa in recent weeks, with about half of the deaths occurring in Kenya. So, we should expect rain to fall at this time of year but this is far heavier than usual. Weather experts say the rains have been enhanced by a phenomenon called the Indian Ocean Dipole which, when positive, can cause a rise in water temperatures in the Indian Ocean of up to 2C.
