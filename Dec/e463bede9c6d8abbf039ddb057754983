Buhari who was speaking during the Nigerian Supreme Council for Islamic Affairs General Assembly and National Executive Council Meeting over the weekend said social media ought to be regulated before it gets out of hand. The first lady compared Nigeria to China stating that with the big difference in population, Nigeria should be able to regulate social media. "If China can control over 1.3 billion people on social media, I see no reason why Nigeria cannot attempt controlling only 180 million people," she said. "We should either fasten our seat belt, get up and do the needful or we will all regret it very soon," she added. Buhari's statement comes as a proposed social media bill is being deliberated in the Nigerian senate. Nigerians online were not amused with the comparison to China with some urging the first lady to compare Chinese development and politics as well.
