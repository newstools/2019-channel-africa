The Proteas Netball team took control of the game from start to finish for a 54-48 victory over the English Roses. The South Africans had a great start in the first quarter as they were fluent on attack and dominating in possession. Following two previous tough matches, which they lost to the Commonwealth champions, the home side led proceedings to unsettle England. There was more energy and aggression in a quick passing game to take a 16-10 lead in quarter one. The South Africans continued from where they left off taking advantage of an England side that was battling in attack in the second quarter. The home side defence was superior which allowed them to open up an eight point lead half way through the quarter. Although England tried to force themselves into the match, the Proteas managed to hold on to a six point gap at half time with the score 27-21. England made more changes in the next quarter bringing in Francesca Williams to try strength their defence. The tactical change worked as they were able to reduce to two points midway through the quarter and finally managing to level matters with five minutes remaining. However, the hosts fought back to take a five point lead going into the final 15 minutes. They capitalised on the advantage and pushed for a comfortable lead once against making it difficult for the visitors to score. “I think we all stepped up. we put the pressure and converted all our turnovers. I think from the defence side yesterday, we didn’t do well and then we tried our best to take a lot of balls and we were ready to be able to convert all the turnovers,” says Phumza Maweni, who is the Proteas goalkeeper.
