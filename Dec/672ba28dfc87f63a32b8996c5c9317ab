The 32-year-old Russian hasn't played since a first round loss to career-long rival Serena Williams at the US Open in August. "Hi Brisbane, I have missed you so much and I am so excited to start my season at your tournament and in your city," Sharapova said in a video message on her Instagram account. "I am looking forward to seeing you all in a couple of days." Sharapova has slipped to 133 in the world rankings after a 2019 season plagued by a shoulder injury which limited her to just 15 competitive matches. She won the Brisbane title in 2015.
