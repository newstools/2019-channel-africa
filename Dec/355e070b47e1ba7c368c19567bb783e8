Meng’s legal team has contested her extradition in the Canadian courts on grounds that the United States (US) is using it for economic and political gain, and that she was unlawfully held, searched and interrogated by Canadian authorities acting for the US’ Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI). 

Associate Chief Justice, Heather Holmes, in the Supreme Court of British Columbia agreed with Huawei Technologies’ appeal for Canada’s attorney general to release more documents relating to the run-up to and events of the arrest. Meng’s team believes the papers will support its claim of an abuse of process. 

Holmes cautioned that her ruling was limited and does not address the merit of Huawei’s allegations that Canadian authorities improperly handled identifying information about Meng’s electronic devices. 

The Department of Justice told Reuters Canada’s attorney general was reviewing the decision to determine what fell within the scope of the disclosure order, in order to comply with it. “Meng is being afforded a fair process before the British Columbia Supreme Court in accordance with extradition law and our treaty with the US,” a spokesperson added. “This will continue throughout these proceedings.” 

Huawei declined to comment. 

Meng, 47, was arrested at the Vancouver International Airport on December 1, 2018, at the request of the US, where she is charged with bank fraud and accused of misleading the bank HSBC about Huawei Technologies’ business in Iran. She has said she is innocent and is fighting extradition.
