His comments come amid allegations linking him and his daughter to the illegal sale of the highly sought-after rosewood tree logs, locally known as mukula. The investigation on the illegal trade of the mukula tree logs was carried out by the US-based Environmental Investigation Agency. There have been further reports that some members of his cabinet have shared residential plots in a degazetted forest. But Lungu has denied the allegations, saying falsehoods in the media have the potential to endanger national peace, stability and unity. “I wish to state categorically that any talk of my involvement in the illegal trade of mukula is a complete falsehood which is aimed at trying to form a distasteful caricature of my administration and I, in the minds of the Zambians.” He added that "fake news" could discourage domestic and foreign direct investment, and in the end, disrupt or negate gains made on national development priorities. Many Zambians are frustrated by the never-ending news of alleged corruption in the government amidst economic hardship. --BBC--
