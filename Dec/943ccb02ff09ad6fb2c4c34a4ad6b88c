Smith is the most successful captain in test history and will seek in the new role to turn around the fortunes of an ailing South Africa side, who have lost their last five tests in a row to Sri Lanka and India, two of which were by an innings. Jacques Faul was appointed acting chief executive of Cricket South Africa last week after Thabang Moroe was suspended over governance concerns, and major sponsor Standard Bank decided not to renew their contract in April 2020. “I am delighted that Graeme has agreed to assist Cricket South Africa up until the IPL next year,” Faul said in a statement on Wednesday.
