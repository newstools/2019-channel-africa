Heavily armed pirates operating off the West African coast have reportedly infiltrated the main port of Libreville in Gabon. They have attacked at least four ships and seized hostages. The vessels include fishing boats and cargo ships. Pirate attacks off the coast of West Africa have become frequent in the last year but this raid so close to shore is both unusual and audacious. A government spokesperson in Gabon said the pirates came into Libreville harbour and attacked multiple vessels. The ships' captive was killed and four Chinese workers were abducted. Foreigners are often targeted by the pirates who demand ransoms from their companies for their return. In recent weeks, nine foreign nationals have been seized from a fishing boat off Benin and four more from an oil tanker near Togo.
