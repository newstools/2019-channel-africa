The carrier points to wider losses this year despite several cost cutting measures. In a notice signed by Kenya Airways Board Chair Michael Joseph, the troubled airline blamed the performance on stiff competition. “Although Kenya Airways realised improved revenue growth in the year, profitability was constrained by the increased competition in the airline's area of operations which, in turn, has increased pressure on pricing in order to remain competitive,” he said. “In addition, the adoption of new International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) 16 rules in 2019 has required significant adjustments to both the profit and loss statements and balance sheets for the current financial year,” he added. The troubled airline has been making efforts to improve earnings after several years of posting losses. --BusinessDaily--
