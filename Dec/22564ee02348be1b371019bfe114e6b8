Mubaiwa who is in custody facing charges of attempted murder, is in "visible poor health, being visibly traumatised and having lost a considerable amount of weight", the newspaper reports the lawyers as saying. They argues that she should be freed on bail to get medical attention. Ms Mubaiwa was present in the rally in June 2018 in Bulawayo where a grenade went off. She sustained minor injuries at the time, according to Reuters news agency. She was arrested on December 14 and charged with attempting to kill her husband while he was being treated in South Africa. Mubaiwa pleaded not guilty and is being held in custody until the trial.
