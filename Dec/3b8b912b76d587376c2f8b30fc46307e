Union leader, Moibah Johnson, told the BBC that the decision was reached after consultations with religious officials and senior civil servants. The union was urged to reach an agreement with the government. Johnson said civil servants were returning to work as negotiations continue. The strike was largely heeded across Liberia on Monday.Â 

Many civil servants have not been paid for several months and the strike spurred the government to disburse October's salaries.
