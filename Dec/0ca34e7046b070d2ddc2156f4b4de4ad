Trump's remarks sent stock prices tumbling and triggered a rush into safe assets such as US Treasury debt. MSCI's measure of global stock performance slid 0.9%, while the US benchmark S&P 500 Index .SPX dropped 1.22%, its largest fall in nearly two months.

“I have no deadline, no,” Trump told reporters in London, where he was due to attend a meeting of NATO leaders. “In some ways, I like the idea of waiting until after the election for the China deal. But they want to make a deal now, and we’ll see whether or not the deal’s going to be right; it’s got to be right.” Investors piled into government bonds, driving the yield on the 10-year U.S. Treasury note to a one-month low near 1.7%. The dollar weakened against a basket of key trading partners’ currencies. Trump’s comments came as sources in Beijing and Washington familiar with the talks said that the two countries have made progress, but are still wrangling over whether existing US tariffs will be removed and over specific levels of Chinese purchases of US agricultural products as part of a “phase one” trade deal. “The Chinese side must have such a requirement, because the Chinese side has promised more US agricultural purchases. This is in a way, to some extent, a transaction,” a Chinese source who advises Beijing on the talks told Reuters. A Washington-based source briefed on the talks said that the US side is willing to remove some tariffs, but wants additional concessions from Beijing to curb the forced transfer of American technology to Chinese firms. While the deal being discussed includes new protections for trademarks, copyrights and other intellectual property, trade sources have said it would leave the most difficult technology transfer issues to future talks.
