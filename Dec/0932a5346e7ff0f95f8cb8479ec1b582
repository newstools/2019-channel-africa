This is according to Nigeria Football Federation General Secretary, Mohammed Sanusi, and follows a high-profile friendly with Brazil in Singapore, as well as a trip to play Ukraine. Sanusi also confirmed the side would only be seeking friendly matches against teams placed higher than them on the world rankings. “We want to maximise the FIFA’s windows by playing quality matches. It is not about playing matches but about quality opposition to strengthen the Super Eagles,” he told Opera News. “It is fairly a long time since we played Italy and we will want to take them on again. We also need a friendly match against Germany. “We are not interested in teams below us in FIFA’s ranking. There is one thing the friendly against Brazil did, it helps to boost and give Eagles the necessary confidence.” --AllAfrica--
