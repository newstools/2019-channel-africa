New Zealand Rugby (NZR) opted for continuity in naming Foster, who was the preferred candidate of illustrious departing coach Steve Hansen, under whom he worked for eight years. 

He beat main rival, Scott Robertson, to the job despite the Crusaders Mentor winning three straight Super Rugby titles, with New Zealand Rugby saying the 54-year-old offered "fresh energy. He brings world-class international experience to the role, an incredibly strong coaching team, and we think he'll do an outstanding job," Chairperson, Brent Impey, said in a statement. 

Foster, who has signed a two-year contract, which stops short of the 2023 World Cup in France, said he was humbled to take over one of the most coveted roles in rugby. He said he was pleased to step into the shoes of the "big fella" Hansen and wanted to build on his legacy of a success rate approaching 90%. "Obviously we need to grow, we need to tweak, we didn't get what we wanted in the last World Cup, losing that semi-final," he said, referring to the 19-7 defeat by Eddie Jones' England in Japan. 

"I'm extremely passionate about adding a new touch, to really grow and get some mana back on the field, which we felt we've lost a little bit," Foster added, using the Maori word for aura. Despite working under Hansen during a period of outstanding All Blacks success, including winning the 2015 World Cup, Foster is a controversial choice for some Kiwi rugby fans. Critics point to an uninspiring eight-year spell in charge of the Chiefs, when their best result was a losing appearance in the 2009 final. 

NZR are gambling that he can maintain the success achieved under Hansen and repeat the smooth transition his predecessor made from assistant to head coach. However, the fact that his contract does not run until the next World Cup may be a sign that NZR chiefs are hedging their bets.
