Unplanned breakdowns at generating units were at 13 154MW at 06:30 on Friday morning, more than a quarter of Eskom's total nominal capacity. This is still well above the level of 9 500MW the utility is aiming for. "Our technical teams will continue to work over the holiday period to monitor the situation, carry out planned maintenance and to work at reducing unplanned breakdowns to below 9 500MW to enable us to minimise the possibility of load shedding," it said in a morning update. "We continue to ask customers to reduce demand as a concerted collective effort can help to avoid or lessen the level of load shedding." President Cyril Ramaphosa, addressing the media last week after cutting short an official visit to Egypt, said Eskom management had given him an assurance that the utility "should not be in a position to have any form of load shedding" between December 17 and January 15, 2020. Ramaphosa added that he had instructed all managers that leave until January is cancelled.
