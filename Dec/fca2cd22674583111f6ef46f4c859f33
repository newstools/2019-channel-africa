It’s aimed at exposing young golfers from disadvantaged areas to golf. Getting into the swing of things, Kamte knows what it takes to compete at the highest level. He is a product of the Ernie Els Foundation and turned professional in 2004. He then started giving golfing clinics in 2015. “I always wanted to give back but I couldn’t do it back then due to my hectic traveling. But now the time is right and they have shown dedication and commitment. I have no doubt that one day, they will turn into professional golfers and they will make their community proud.” Golfer, Bridget Gasa says that Kamte always had a passion to develop golf in this region. “It’s nice to see someone exposing golf to disadvantage golfers, he has done a really good job and the kids have responded positively, he is making a huge difference.” Young golfer, Sonwabile Matshoba, says that he is glad to be part of this winning foundation: “James is teaching us a lot about golf and we are very confident. The future looks good.” Kamte’s sights are now on next year’s European Tour but he will first tee it up at the South African Open at Rand Park Golf Club early January. --SABC--
