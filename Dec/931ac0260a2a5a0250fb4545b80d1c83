De Ruyter was announced as the new Eskom CEO in November. He was slated to start working on January 15, 2020. The announcement comes a week after Eskom had to institute stage 6 load shedding for the first time, which caused President Cyril Ramaphosa to return to South Africa from an official trip to Egypt. Mthembu said on Tuesday that Gordhan is expected to negotiate with De Ruyter to start his duties before January. “Together with his team, he will be able to deal with the concerning issues at Eskom, including governance, financial management and improvement of operations at Eskom." Mthembu said that, in light of clear governance, operational and maintenance challenges at the debt-laden power utility, Cabinet thought it best that Eskom have stable full time leadership as soon as possible. “We would like the new CEO to start as soon as possible. That is the mandate that Cabinet has given to the minister of public enterprises,” said Mthembu. The energy war room will also be re-established and chaired by Deputy President David Mabuza. It will also include Minister of Finance Mboweni, Minister of Energy Gwede Mantashe and Gordhan.
