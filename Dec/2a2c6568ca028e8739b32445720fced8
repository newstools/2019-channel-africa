European equities edged higher after falling the day before as Britain’s Prime Minister Boris Johnson took a harder line on Brexit. Earlier, Asian shares drifted down. Japan's Nikkei .N225 dipped 0.6% and China's stocks slipped .CSI300 even after Beijing trimmed another short-term interest rate. United States equity futures ESc1 1YMc1 were up and MSCI’s world stock index .MIWD00000PUS stood just off record highs. It has rallied almost 23% this year, set for its best year in a decade and the fourth-best year ever. A run of better data recently has helped calm fears of a recession while phase one of a Sino-U.S. deal on trade appears to have eased some of the uncertainty on the global outlook. German business morale rose more than expected in December to a six-month high, the Ifo survey showed on Wednesday, suggesting that Europe’s largest economy picked up steam in the fourth quarter. “I expect markets to end the year quietly but mildly positively, especially if the PBoC does nibble down the lending interest rate later this week,” said Chris Bailey European strategist at Raymond James, referring to China’s central bank. “Bigger challenges naturally await for next year ... but I think traders and investors will be happier to grapple with these actually in 2020.”
