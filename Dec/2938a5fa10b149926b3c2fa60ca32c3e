The attack on the military post in the Tahoua region happened early on Monday morning and was led by heavily armed "terrorists" in a dozen 4x4 vehicles, the minister is reported as saying. He said they fought for two hours until the attackers retreated. The statement on state TV added that the gunmen fled towards Mali after the battle. Armed men attacked another army post on Tuesday evening, AFP quotes a security source as saying. Tuesday's attack took place in the area around Inates, according to the source. "The attackers came in their dozens, in small groups on motorcycles" and surrounded the camp, the source said. Niger and other countries in the Sahel region have been facing a growing threat from Islamist militants, including the Islamic State group and affiliates of al-Qaeda. The groups are most active in Mali but often stage cross-border raids. --BBC--
