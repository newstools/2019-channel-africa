Van Heerden, who spent three years at Club Brugge, playing close to 60 matches, believes that Tau is at the right club and will help him to flourish in Europe. The difference is that Tau is on loan from English Premier League club Brighton Hove and Albion. Van Heerden says Tau is making good progress at Brugge.

Van Heerden left the country when he was only 19, to join Danish top side FC Copenhagen from their Port Elizabeth based School of Excellence, UPE-FCK. He believes that this is what we need to go back, sending more young players to European leagues. Currently the KwaZulu-Natal academy and other academies from around the country are doing their bit in exporting talent to smaller leagues in Europe. The South African U23 national team had the likes of Luther Singh (Portugal), Lyle Foster (Belgium) and thereâ€™s more players like Thabo Cele (Portugal), Gift Links and Liam Jordan (Denmark) who are already in that space. Van Heerden says its good for the players to go to leagues when they will get game time.
