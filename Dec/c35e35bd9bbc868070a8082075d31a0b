The contest is the first to be held amid December winter conditions in nearly 100 years. In October, Members of Parliament (MPs) voted for the snap poll after talks over Brexit gridlocked. A total of 650 MPs will be chosen in the election, in which the candidate who secures the most votes in each individual constituency is elected. Locals say they hope the vote will help the country's leaders decide on way forward on Brexit. Meanwhile, British party leaders pushed through the final moments of their campaign blitz on Wednesday to win over votes. Prime Minister Boris Johnson, who has travelled to the heartlands of Brexit Britain in a bid to secure the parliamentary majority he needs to take the country out of the European Union, was doorstepping constituents in Essex. Johnson spoke to constituents and hammered down signs bearing his campaign slogan 'Get Brexit Done'. The Prime Minister even clambered onto a wall fence at one point with photographers cheering him on. His main rival, the Labour Party led by Jeremy Corbyn, has focused on promises of sweeping economic steps to benefit struggling Britons. Labour has pledged to begin delivering its plans to end public spending cuts and begin nationalising industries within the first year of taking office. --Reuters--
