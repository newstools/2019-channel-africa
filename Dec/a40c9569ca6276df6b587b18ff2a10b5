The controversial politician had been charged with making irregular payments amounting to over $3.5 million as well as for unlawful acquisition of public property and money laundering. The judge barred him from accessing his office unless he is accompanied by investigators, he has also been blocked from appointing a deputy, stirring a debate about who will be in charge of Nairobi. The capital has not had a deputy governor since the abrupt resignation of Polycarp Igathe, after he fell out with the governor early last year.

Others say the president has powers to dissolve the county’s political administration to pave way for fresh elections.
