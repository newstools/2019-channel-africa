Mthembu was briefing reporters in Pretoria on the outcomes of last week's Cabinet meeting. The Cabinet meeting followed the national flag carrier being placed into business rescue in early December, following a bruising strike and amid difficulty meeting its financial obligations. Les Matuson was appointed the national carrier's business rescue practitioner.

Mthembu said on Tuesday that Cabinet expressed confidence that the intervention would re-position the flag carrier to become a stronger, more competitive entity, which would win back confidence from investors and its passengers. "Cabinet welcomed the appointment of the business rescue practitioner Les Matuson from Matuson Associates. He will work with the black partners that will be announced in due course," said Mthembu.   

Mthembu reminded reporters that SAA would receive an additional $14 million in financial assistance from government to help restructure the airline, over and above the existing $14 million from SAA lenders. "Cabinet is confident that this intervention will restore the reputation of the airline and prevent the collapse which would have had a negative impact on passengers, suppliers and other partners in the aviation sector and, importantly, the workforce," Mthembu said.
