This is the first time that the government has installed surveillance cameras on key roads in Mogadishu to help prevent militant attacks. Al-Shabab often carries out bomb and gunfire attacks in Mogadishu. Last week, its fighters carried out an attack at the Somali Youth League (SYL) hotel that is located near the presidential palace. The group carried out one of its deadliest attacks in Mogadishu in October 2017 after it detonated explosives packed in a truck. More than 300 people are believed to have been killed in the incident that was captured on CCTV. In May, the group ordered businesses in the capital to dismount CCTV cameras from buildings along the city's main roads.
