Police and fire officials said they had rescued at least 58 people and did not expect to find more bodies. The blaze was the worst in Delhi since 59 movie-goers died in a cinema in 1997. 

The cause of the blaze is not yet known, but the city's poor planning and lax enforcement of building and safety codes have often been blamed for such deadly incidents. 

The building's owner and manager were arrested on Sunday, police told the Press Trust of India news agency. Tearful relatives spoke of receiving desperate calls from factory workers begging to be saved from the inferno in the poorly lit premises in the commercial hub of Sadar Bazar. 

The fire started around 05:00 (23:30 GMT Saturday). 

A man named Musharaff who was trapped inside the four-storey structure made a desperate phone call to ask that his children be looked after. "Monu, brother, I am going to die today," he said in the recording of a call played by the ABP Hindi language news channel. "Please take care of my kids. I can't breathe. 

"There are so many others here. Just can't breathe," he kept repeating in Hindi, before finally breaking down. Authorities said they do not know if Musharaff was among the survivors.
