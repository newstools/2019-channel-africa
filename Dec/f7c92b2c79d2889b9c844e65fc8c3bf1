Cyrus Ngo’o, General Manager of the Port Authority of Douala (PAD) announced on Monday that RTC (“Regie du Terminal a Conteneur”) will be in charge of the terminal as a transitional measure. As a sweetener, traders will from January enjoy a 10 per cent discount on tariffs for offshore handling and haulage. The port also serves landlocked Chad and Central Africa Republic. Though he said the management body was created in accordance with the PAD law that came into force last January, the decision comes in the backdrop of intense diplomatic contest between France and Switzerland to have their companies control the lucrative business at Douala which is considered the Atlantic gateway to Central Africa. Cameroon’s president, Paul Biya last October ordered PAD General Manager to suspend contract negotiations with Terminal Investment Limited (TIL) of Switzerland to take over terminal management from French conglomerate Bolloré Group. --TheEastAfrican--
