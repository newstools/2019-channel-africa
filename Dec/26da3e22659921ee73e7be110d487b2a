Bozize, who was ousted in a 2013 coup, was making his first public appearance nearly a week after returning to the country following six years away. He drove through the district in a car, followed by his supporters and acclaimed by hundreds of local residents gathered by the side of the road. A former armed forces chief, Bozize seized power in CAR, one of the world's poorest and most unstable countries, in March 2003. He held office for a decade before being overthrown by a coalition of mainly Muslim armed groups, the Seleka. But his return has raised questions about his motives, with observers speculating he could be preparing for his candidature in next year's election. It's unclear how Boziz√© will be treated especially since he is in the United Nations sanctions list. The former President fled the CAR after the Seleka rebel coalition which accused him of not honouring peace agreements seized the presidential palace in the capital, Bangui. --AfricaNews--
