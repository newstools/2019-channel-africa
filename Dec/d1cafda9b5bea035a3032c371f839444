It’s the first time the Swiss authorities have confirmed the probe that began in March 2018. The Swiss are scrutinizing earlier allegations that the trader, Christoph Huber, was involved in the illegal trade of minerals during the Congo conflict two decades ago, a spokesperson for the Swiss Federal Prosecutor’s Office said by email. Two non-governmental organizations, TRIAL International and the Open Society Justice Initiative, filed a criminal complaint against Huber to the Office of the Attorney General in late 2016, the groups said. Huber, a Swiss national based in South Africa, didn’t respond to multiple emails and calls requesting comment. He hasn’t commented publicly on the allegations or the on-going investigation and hasn’t been charged with anything. The prosecutor’s office can’t predict the outcome of the probe, a spokesperson said in an emailed response to questions on November 28. Congo was torn apart from 1998 to 2003, when Rwanda and Uganda backed different rebel groups in efforts to depose the nation’s government. United Nations investigations found that the invading armies profited from the illicit extraction and sale of Congo’s coltan, diamonds, gold and other inerals during the war, in which millions of people died. About a decade ago, concerns that some traders were operating in an unregulated industry and bankrolling militias and national armies in central Africa’s Great Lakes region, which by then had become the origin of most of the world’s coltan, helped spawn the Dodd-Frank Act in the U.S., the largest consumer of tantalum products. The law and other initiatives sought to ensure that the trade in tantalum, tin, tungsten and gold should no longer contribute to the cycle of violence in eastern Congo, where hundreds of militias continue to terrorize the local population. --Bloomberg--
