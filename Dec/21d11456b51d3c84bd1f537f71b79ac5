The beginning of 2020 looks tense for the South African economy. That’s enough to keep government on its toes for any eventuality. A recent Intellidex report indicates three particularly crucial decisions to be made in 2020 will be on the public sector wage bill, Eskom’s debt, which must result in a solution in the coming fiscal year and finally the Energy policy which is a politically complex matter. Energy policy is going to be a main focus, because it is linked to load shedding and it shows how urgency can manifest into positive spin. Apart from the three main focuses there are many other issues that need unlocking, such as spectrum, infrastructure and skills visas among others. --SABC--
