The industry body said this is largely due to government taxes and fees, as well as low load factors. Furthermore, aviation markets in Africa are seen as "very fragmented and inefficiently served in the absence, so far, of a single African air transport market", according to IATA. Data recently released by IATA showed that African carriers posted the fastest cargo growth of any region in October 2019, with an increase in demand of 12.6% compared to the same period a year earlier. Strong trade and investment links with Asia contributed to the positive performance. Freight volumes on key Africa-Asia routes were up 23% annually in September, according to the latest available data. According to Chris Zweigenthal, Chief Executive Officer of the Airlines Association of Southern Africa (AASA), South Africa's domestic air transport market is one of the most robustly competitive in Africa, with local carriers engaged in fierce competition. Against the backdrop of South African Airways recently having been placed in business rescue, Zweigenthal said AASA would like the business rescue scenario to give the aviation and related industries a chance to adjust and adapt, ensuring that those they serve are provided with sustainable, competitive, capable, reliable and safe services. IATA forecasts that the global airline industry will produce a net profit of $29.3 billion in 2020, improved over a net profit of $25.9 billion expected in 2019, revised downward from a $28 billion forecast in June. Airlines are expected to contribute a total of $136 billion to government coffers in tax revenues in 2020, a 5.2% increase over 2019. Global passenger numbers are expected to reach 4.72 billion, up 4.0% from 4.54 billion in 2019. Freight tons carried are expected to recover to 62.4 million, a 2.0% increase over 61.2 million tons carried in 2019, which was the lowest figure in three years. The average net profit per departing passenger is globally is expected to be $6.20 in 2020, compared to $5.70 in 2019. According to Alexandre de Juniac, IATAâ€™s Director General, slowing economic growth, trade wars, geopolitical tensions and social unrest, plus continuing uncertainty over Brexit all came together to create a tougher than anticipated business environment for airlines.
