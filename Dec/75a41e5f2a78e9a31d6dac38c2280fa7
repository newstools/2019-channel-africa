Consequently, a statement posted on the embassy’s website says, previously scheduled appointments have been cancelled. “We regret there are no slots available for rescheduling at the moment,” it adds. The embassy assured applicants “with genuine emergencies” that their appointments will be expedited. The notice comes just days after the embassy announced the withdrawal of its Peace Corps volunteers from 12 of Liberia’s 15 counties due to the effects of the on-going economic crisis hurting the country. Though temporary, this visa move has caused worries in Liberia, a country founded in 1847 by former African slaves repatriated from the USA. But the ministry of foreign affairs in Monrovia has assured the public that relationship with the US government remains cordial. --BBC--
