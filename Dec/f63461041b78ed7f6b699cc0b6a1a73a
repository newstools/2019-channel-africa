The Markit Stanbic Bank Kenya Purchasing Managers’ Index (PMI) for manufacturing and services was 53.2, the same as in October. Readings above 50 indicate growth. The survey said new orders that Kenyan companies received during the month expanded at the slowest rate in six months. Output grew at the fastest pace in four months. Kenyan authorities last month removed a cap on commercial interest rates in place since 2016 that had been blamed for stifling private sector lending growth and reducing the effectiveness of monetary policy. Jibran Qureishi, regional economist for East Africa at Stanbic, said the change would boost business activity. “As commercial banks begin to extend credit, the private sector will be in a much better position than it, has been for the past two and a half years,” he said. --Reuters--
