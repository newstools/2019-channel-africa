The US is due to impose tariffs on almost $160 billion of Chinese imports such as video game consoles, computer monitors and toys on Sunday. US President, Donald Trump, is expected to meet top trade advisers on Thursday to discuss the move, sources told Reuters previously. 

A decision to proceed with the levies could roil financial markets and scuttle US-China talks to end the 17-month-long trade war between the world’s two largest economies. “The two sides’ economic and trade teams are maintaining close communication,” Gao Feng, Spokesperson at the Chinese Commerce Ministry, told reporters at a regular briefing. The countries agreed in October to conclude a preliminary trade agreement, but talks have failed to produce deals on agricultural purchases by China and rollbacks of existing tariffs imposed by the US. Many analysts had expected a deal ahead of December 15. Beijing has said it would retaliate if the United States escalates the trade dispute. In August, China said it would impose 5% and 10% in additional tariffs on $75 billion of US goods in two batches. Tariffs on the first batch kicked in on Sept. 1, hitting US goods including soybeans, pork, beef, chemicals and crude oil. The tariffs on the second batch of products are due to be activated on Dec. 15, affecting goods ranging from corn and wheat to small aircraft and rare earth magnets. China also said at the time that it will reinstitute on December 15 an additional 25% tariff on United States-made vehicles and 5% tariffs on auto parts that had been suspended at the beginning of 2019.
