Nineteen-year-old Ann Nduku fell into a River Kandisi in Ongata Rongai, on the outskirts of the capital Nairobi on Tuesday. Nduku was responding to the cries of help of a man who was clinging to one of the bridge structures under construction. The man survived but as she tried to save him she fell into the river. Her mother, Elizabeth Mutuku, told me about the moment she learnt her daughter had fallen into the river and her desperate attempts to help her. The river is swollen after huge amount of rain which started on Monday and have been seen across East Africa. However, residents say more than seven people have been swept away over the last two years. An old bridge was removed two years ago and the construction of the new bridge is incomplete so residents have been using stepping stones to get to the other side of the river. Ndukuâ€™s older sister Maryam Zenneth told me she blames local authorities for failing to finish a crucial bridge that links the village to the main market town of Rongai. Her mother is left heartbroken.
