The two ex-premiers are Ahmed Ouyahia and Abdelmalek Sellal. 

The trial is the first resulting from sweeping investigations into fraud allegations launched after Bouteflika stepped down in April in the face of mass protests which erupted in February against his bid for a fifth term. 

In all, 19 defendants, two former prime ministers, other prominent ex-politicians and automotive industry tycoons, face charges ranging from money laundering to abuse of office and granting undue privileges. 

A similar sentence is requested for former industry minister Abdeslam Bouchouareb, who is being tried in absentia as he has fled abroad. The State Prosecutor has called for an international arrest warrant to be issued against Bouchouareb. It is the first time since Algeria's independence from France in 1962 that former prime ministers have been put on trial. 

The proceedings have been dominated by accusations of illegal funding during Bouteflika's last election campaign. The trial began on Wednesday and the verdict will be delivered today, two days before a contentious presidential election which protesters dismiss as an illegitimate attempt by the establishment to consolidate its power.
