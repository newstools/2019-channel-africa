Serigne Khadim Gueye was convicted along with four parents and the metalworker who made the chains. They were arrested last month after a photo shared on social media showed several children in the northern town of Ndiagne with chains around their feet. The case has split opinion in the Muslim-majority nation, where many thousands of children attend Koranic schools. Some parents argued that they didnâ€™t know chaining a child was illegal. There have been similar cases of horrific abuse in Nigeria, where the government has responded by shutting down some of the schools. --AFP--
