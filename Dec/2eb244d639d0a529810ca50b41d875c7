The average LNG price for January delivery into northeast Asia is estimated to be about $5.50 per million British thermal units (mmBtu), down 10 cents from the previous week, several industry sources said. “It’s still looking pretty bearish for January,” a Singapore-based LNG trader said. “There are some pockets of demand, but way too much supply.” Russia’s Sakhalin 2 plant probably sold a cargo for loading on Jan. 22 at $5.70 to $5.90 per mmBtu, an industry source said, although this could not immediately be confirmed. Angola LNG offered a cargo for delivery over late January to mid-February in a tender that closes next week. GAIL (India) has also offered up to 10 cargoes on a free-on-board (FOB) basis from the Sabine Pass and Cove Point LNG plants in the US for loading from early next year to early 2021, industry sources said. In the United States, Cheniere Energy asked US energy and safety regulators to approve a process to return to service a storage tank that leaked at its Sabine Pass LNG export plant. The lower spot prices appeared to stoke some demand from China, Japan and India. China’s Guangzhou Gas and Japan’s Tohoku Electric Power each sought a cargo for delivery in late January, industry sources said. In India, Gujarat State Petroleum Corp (GSPC) is seeking a cargo for delivery in January while Reliance Industries sought a cargo for delivery over the second-half of January, industry sources said. Pakistan LNG is seeking a cargo for delivery over February 16 to 17 in a tender that closes on December 17, a tender document showed.
