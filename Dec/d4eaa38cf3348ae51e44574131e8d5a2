Reports suggest that both the Blaugrana and fierce rivals Real Madrid will come back in pursuit of the PSG forward in the New Year, potentially leaving a huge void PSG’s attack. Mane has been one of Europe’s form players this season, and heads into the club’s English Premier League fixture at home to Watford this weekend having scored 13 and assisted a further eight goals in in 22 appearances across all competitions.
