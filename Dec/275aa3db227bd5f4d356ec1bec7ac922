The evergreen 43-year-old, who teamed with world number four Justin Thomas on the opening two days, has been one of the biennial event's best players, but said he cannot do everything. Instead, Rickie Fowler will join Thomas for the opening clash against Australian Marc Leishman and Li Haotong, who will become the first Chinese golfer to play a Presidents Cup match after being overlooked for the first two days. "That was kind of the game plan. It would be hard for me to go all the sessions," the 15-time major winner said on why he was not playing again. "I've been fortunate enough to go out there with JT (Justin Thomas) and we've gotten two points. JT played great and Rickie played awesome this afternoon. They have been looking forward to playing with one another. They have had success before, and we'll send them back out." Ernie Els' International team lead 6.5-3.5 heading into day three.
