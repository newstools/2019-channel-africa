The 34-year-old Briton had little time to bask in the glory of his stunning dominance of Sunday's Abu Dhabi Grand Prix before being pressed to talk about his future and a possible switch from the Silver Arrows to Ferrari. The six-time world champion was circumspect, however, in his answers during post-race interviews in which he declined offers to deny that he had already spoken to the Italian team's chairman, John Elkann. Hamilton's current contract with Mercedes ends in 2020, leaving him free to move for the 2021 season when Formula One ushers in a radical new set of rules that may coincide with Sebastian Vettel choosing to leave Ferrari, possibly for Mercedes in a dramatic swap with Hamilton, or to retire. Hamilton, owner of two high-performance Ferrari road cars, made clear that he is simply looking around to weigh up his options beyond next year when he may equal Michael Schumacher's record of seven drivers' championship titles. He also made clear that he is in no rush to make any decisions, a position applauded by his current team chief Toto Wolff who may also be considering his future when the sport shifts into a new era. Wolff said he felt there was a 75% likelihood that Hamilton would stay and sign a new contract, likely to be his last as an F1 driver, with Mercedes - but he said also that there was a clear 25% chance that he may move.
