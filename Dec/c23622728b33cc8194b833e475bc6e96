The innovative scheme by the UN's World Food Programme (WFP), UKAID and Denmark's DanChurchAid (DCA) is helping thousands of urban households that each day face a struggle to survive. "We used to fill the children's school lunch boxes with porridge, but now they get popcorn and crisps -- they are happy," said Anna Kubeta, a 63-year-old beneficiary. The visually-impaired grandmother shares a cramped three-bedroom brick cottage with one of her adult children and four grandchildren, all of them school-going age. Her 35-year-old son Aaron Munyoro, who has been unemployed for 15 years, receives the family's cash aid on his phone every month. "Thanks to the cash transfers, their (kids') diet is less monotonous these days. We actually can afford some meat and flour," Munyoro said. The combination of an economic meltdown and extreme drought has seriously worsened the plight of Zimbabweans, who were already struggling. Nearly half of Zimbabwe's 15 million people live in a state of chronic food insecurity, some 2.2 million in urban areas and five million in the countryside, according to UN figures. In a visit last month, the UN special rapporteur on the right to food, Hilal Elver, warned that Zimbabwe was on the "brink of man-made starvation".
