BoU Governor, Emmanuel Mutebile, said in a statement that defacing the banknotes risked destroying their security features and could lead to "the risk of loss of value" and shorten their life span. Banknotes with messages of support for musician turned opposition politician Bobi Wine are among those shared on social media. Others backing President Yoweri Museveni re-election in the 2021 elections have also been shared. --BBC--
