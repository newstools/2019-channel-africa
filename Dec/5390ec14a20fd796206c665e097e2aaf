The exact death toll is yet to be released by the Somali government, but initial reports indicate that 90 people had died. At least 100 more people were injured in the attack at a busy checkpoint in the capital Mogadishu. MJC deputy president, Moulana Abdul Khaliq Allie, says the MJC stands strong with the people of Somalia. “It saddens our hearts that as the year (2019) comes to an end, we find ourselves in a situation where Somalia is once again rocked by a devastating, murderous attack by individuals or a group. The MJC stands strong with the people of Somalia in condemning this horrendous attack on innocent people.” Meanwhile, a Turkish military cargo plane has landed in the Somali capital to evacuate people who were badly wounded in the attack. The plane also brought emergency medical staff and supplies, according to a tweet from the Turkish embassy. Somali Information Minister Mohamed Abdi Hayir Mareye says 10 badly injured Somalis would be evacuated to Turkey. He added that Turkey had sent 24 doctors to treat the wounded who could not be evacuated.
