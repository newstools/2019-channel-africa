The Libyan government said Emirati drones had carried out violent raids on the residential area of al-Swani. It said there was no military infrastructure there. A government spokesman said unmanned Emirati aircraft had also launched two raids on a bridge west of Tripoli. There's been heavy fighting in and around Tripoli since April, when an eastern-based militia leader, General Khalifa Haftar, launched an offensive to seize the capital from armed groups backing the internationally recognised government. The United Arab Emirates has denied it supports General Haftar's forces. The United Nation says at least 200 civilians and more than 2,000 fighters have been killed since he began his assault. --BBC--
