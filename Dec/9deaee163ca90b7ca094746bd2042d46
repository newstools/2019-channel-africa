The official death toll after Monday's explosion on White Island climbed to six late Tuesday when another victim died in hospital. 

The bodies of eight more people are believed to be on the island, but it is still too dangerous for the teams of rescuers to travel there and for forensic pathologists, odonatologists and other victim identification experts to begin their work. 

The Ministry of Health said 22 survivors still being treated in hospital burns units around the country remained in a critical condition. 

When the volcano exploded it is believed to have sent superheated steam, ash and cannonball-like rocks hurtling from the caldera at supersonic speed. 

Police Minister Stuart Nash said injuries to tourists and guides exploring at the time were so severe that some victims could not identify themselves. "There are a number of people in hospital who cannot communicate, they have significant burns not only to skin but internal organs," he told Radio New Zealand. "We're working very closely with a number of agencies to ensure we get this identification right." 

A total of 47 day-trippers and guides were on the island when the blast occurred, hailing from Australia, the United States, Britain, China, Germany, Malaysia and New Zealand.
