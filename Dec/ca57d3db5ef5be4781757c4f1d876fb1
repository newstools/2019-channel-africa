Mitiga airport has been repeatedly targeted in attacks blamed on the forces of the renegade general Khalifa Haftar, who has been trying to capture Tripoli since April. While the airport was shut, flights were diverted to the city of Misrata, 200km away. Mitiga became the capital's only functioning airport after rival armed groups destroyed Tripoli International during fighting in 2014. --BBC--
