The United States have dominated the biennial competition since it began in 1994 and Scott said the 50-year-old Els had done his homework so the International Team could get to grips with the par-71 course at Royal Melbourne. “Ernie, the assistants and the guys who have played here have really settled our first timers to Royal Melbourne nicely. I’m very optimistic,” Scott told a news conference. “Ernie has done a lot of the prep work for us and kind of laid the foundations. I’ve had a good feeling for the last couple months about the way our team shaped up. I feel a very, very strong energy, which certainly over some of the past Cups we’ve been lacking. It’s not a lot of fun getting beaten all the time.” South African Els, part of the International Team’s only win in the tournament’s 25-year history in 1998 at Royal Melbourne, said on Wednesday he had been crunching the numbers to see which golfers were compatible with each other. The preparation did not start there though, with Scott adding that Els looked to bring together team members playing at the same tournament on the PGA Tour for practice rounds.

The Presidents Cup tees off on Thursday with the fourballs where Scott is paired with South Korea’s An Byeong-hun to take on Bryson DeChambeau and Tony Finau.
