Lawyer Dong Samuel Luak and Aggrey Idri, a member of the Sudan Peopleâ€™s Liberation Movement-In Opposition, disappeared in Kenya in January 2017. "Although the government of South Sudan has denied knowledge of their whereabouts, multiple sources have stated that Dong and Aggrey were extra territorially kidnapped in Kenya by members of the South Sudanese security services and brought back to Juba, South Sudan," a US Treasury Department statement says. It adds that the "government has repeatedly used extrajudicial killings as a means to silence dissent, limit freedom of speech and the press, and enforce the political status quo". The five named by the US government are Abud Stephen Thiongkol, Malual Dhal Muorwel, Michael Kuajien, John Top Lam and Angelo Kuot Garang. They have not yet commented on the US statement. The sanctions will affect any property and interests the men may have in the US. --BBC--
