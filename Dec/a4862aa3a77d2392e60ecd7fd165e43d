"The Archbishop has been hospitalised several times over the past few years for treatment of a similar condition," the Desmond & Leah Tutu Legacy Foundation added in a statement, without giving further detail. Archbishop Tutu won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1984 for the prominent role he played in opposing the racist system of apartheid in South Africa. He became a fierce critic of corruption in the African National Congress after it took power at the end of white minority rule in 1994. --bbc--
