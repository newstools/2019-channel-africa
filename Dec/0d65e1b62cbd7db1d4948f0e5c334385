A judge in Abuja ordered the secret police to free Sowore and pay a fine for their repeated refusal to comply with court rulings on the case. The police had previously refused to grant him bail, despite being told to do so. Sowore, who is the publisher of the news site Sahara Reporters, was arrested in early August after calling online for an anti-government protest under the hashtag #RevolutionNow. He has pleaded not guilty to treason, money laundering and cyber-stalking. Human rights campaigners say the case is part of a broader move to restrict freedom of speech in Nigeria.
