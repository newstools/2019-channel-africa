Speaking on Thursday at the ruling party meeting in Mwanza, Magufuli said the aircraft would be received in Mwanza on a date that is yet to be announced. The President, however, did not disclose the details that led to the release of the aircraft which was impounded after a South African farmer Hermanus Steyn filed a $33 million compensation claim in Canada. According to Foreign Affairs Minister Palamagamba Kabudi the seizure was because of a dispute between Tanzanian government and the retired farmer “seeking compensation for a farm and other properties that was nationalised in the 1980s”. This was the third seizure incident of an Air Tanzania aircraft, in August, South African authorities impounded an Airbus 220-300 leased by Air Tanzania. With a court battle that ensued, the plane was later released after the Gauteng Lower Division court in Dar es Salaam ruled against the seizure. --TheEastAfrican--
