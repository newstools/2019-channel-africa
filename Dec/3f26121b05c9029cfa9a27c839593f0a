He clipped six seconds from the previous record of 26:44 set by Kenya’s Patrick Komon in 2010 to complete a sensational 2019 hat-trick that included world titles in cross country and 10 000 metres on the track. Pacesetter Roy Hoornweg covered the opening kilometre of the World Athletics Silver Label road race in 2:42 before Cheptegei moved to the front briefly demanding a quicker pace, a demand that was met - by the second kilometre the clock read 5:42 for a 2:40km split. Once Hoornweg dropped out, Stephen Kissa and Abdallah Mande took command with Cheptegei in tow, with the trio covering 3km in 7:57, well inside the word record schedule. Cheptegei, 23, overtook the pacemakers before the halfway point, reaching 5km in 13:23; one second shy of the world record for that distance. Running on his own Cheptegei reached 8km in 21:37, when it became clear that the world record was within reach. With 23:59 on the clock at the 9km point, Cheptegei needed to cover the final kilometre in 2:45 - a task well within his capabilities. “World cross champion in Denmark, 10 000m world champion in Doha and now the world record here in Valencia. What a year it has been. I can’t believe it! I knew that Valencia was going to be a really fast course, one of the fastest in the world. So to get to achieve what we came here for is something really special.”
