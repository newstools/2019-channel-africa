Demonstrators are calling for a boycott of a vote they regard as a charade. Protesters also marched in towns in the Kabylie region, where some polling stations have been closed, witnesses and residents said. There are five aspirants on the ballot, but that all of them being former government appointees has not helped matters. Protesters have called for a boycott of the process. Of the five, there are two former prime ministers and two former government ministers, seen largely as people who cannot stand up to the armyâ€™s central role in the polls. Army chief, Ahmed Gaed Salah, has over the months issued stern warnings to people who he said wanted to threaten the security of the nation. He has described the vote as the most viable path to legitimacy of any government. --Reuters--
