The escalating crisis at debt-ridden Eskom Holdings SOC Ltd., shut down South Africa’s key mining industry for 24 hours, hitting gold and platinum producers that had been enjoying a renaissance on the back of higher metal prices. The rolling blackouts threaten to tip South Africa’s economy into recession and hobble miners already impacted by community protests. Johannesburg-based Implats was ordered to cut electricity usage to 55 megawatts from about 300 megawatts, forcing it to reduce power to furnaces by 90% and shutting down refrigeration and compressor plants. “It was drastic, it makes life very difficult,” said Johan Theron, a spokesperson for Implats. “We can’t operate like this but if we don’t cut the power, the national grid collapses.” Power is critical to keep South Africa’s mines running and Eskom is responsible for supplying 95% of the electricity used by the continent’s most advanced economy. Some companies, such as Anglo American Platinum Lts.,  can minimize losses by using expensive diesel generators, but they remain dependent on the utility’s base load supply.  --Bloomberg--
