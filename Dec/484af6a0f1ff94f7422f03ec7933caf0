The case is being heard at the Western Cape high court. One of the seven, Carin Gelderbloem, told a South African news website IOL that she had been fined several times for sleeping on the streets. She said that her identification card and clothes were taken in June when she was fined $34 for littering. She alleged that she had been accused of littering the streets with the cardboard that she uses as a mattress. The cityâ€™s Executive Director for Safety and Security, Richard Bosman, told the news website that he would comment once the case was concluded. --BBC--
