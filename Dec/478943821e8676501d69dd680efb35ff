But as far as Bafana Bafana are concerned, at least, the road to enhanced success has undergone a backflip with the national men's soccer team's FIFA world ranking deteriorating from 56th in 2014 to 72nd as the end of the year approaches. And no matter what progress might have been achieved in other areas, it is the status and success of the national team, like in all other sports, by which South African soccer will, in the main, be judged. If "Vision 2022" launched by SAFA president Danny Jordaan had gone according to plan, Bafana Bafana would have progressed beyond the first round of a World Cup for the first time in 2018. Instead South Africa did not as much as even qualify for the tournament and maintained a gloomy record of not qualifying at all since the 2002 event - taking into account that 2010 participation was only as a result of being the host nation. And with Vision 2022 coming up to expectations Bafana at this juncture would already have made meaningful progress to a place among the top 20 ranked soccer nations in the world and approaching a place among the top three soccer nations in Africa that had been envisaged instead of the current 13th continental place.
