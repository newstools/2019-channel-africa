Filipino fighter Johnriel Casimero caused a huge upset when he beat South Africa’s Zolani Tete in the third round during their fight in Birmingham on Saturday night. Zolani Tete was looking to make another defense of his World Boxing Organisation (WBO) bantamweight title he claimed in a 7th round knockout of Jose Santos Gonzalez in their March 2016 clash. Casimero entered the fight having claimed wins in seven different countries, and was confident of yet another big win on the road. Tete was floored by a crushing right hand forcing him to the canvas. The Mdantsane-born fighter tried to soldier on but found himself on the floor two more times before the referee intervened and called off the fight. This loss for Tete effectively ended his 13-fight win streak and his reign as WBO Bantamweight champion. For Casimero though, he has already talked of a showdown against Japan’s Naoya Inoue, the unbeaten three-division and reigning unified bantamweight champion.
