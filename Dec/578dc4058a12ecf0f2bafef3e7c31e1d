Tebboune took the oath of office at a ceremony televised live on State television from the Palace of Nations in the capital, Algiers. He won the December 12 election with 58% of the vote, with turnout reported at nearly 40%. despite mass protests. After the results were announced on 13 December, State television changed a caption in the top left corner of its screen from "Algeria votes" to "Algeria is victorious". Tens of thousands of people took to the streets of Algiers last Friday chanting slogans against Tebboune, who was a loyalist of ousted leader, Abdelaziz Bouteflika. He resigned in April in the face of nationwide demonstrations against his two-decade long rule.
