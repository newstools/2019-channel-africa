President Paul Biya has recently spoken of granting special status to the English speaking north-west and south-west regions to try to help stem the violence. Analysts say it is highly unlikely that the government will agree to grant a significant level of autonomy. Many Anglophone Cameroonians have felt marginalised for decades by a government dominated by French speakers. It boiled over in 2016, when teachers and lawyers started to protest against the use of French in schools and courts. There are sporadic outbreaks of violence involving the military and separatist rebels in the Anglophone regions and most schools there have remained closed for three years. Some 700 000 people have fled their homes.  --BBC--
