The world’s biggest maker of telecom network equipment and the No. 2 manufacturer of smartphones, was all but banned by the United States in May from doing business with U.S. companies, preventing its access to technology like Google’s (GOOGL.O) Android operating system. The US government alleges Huawei equipment pose national security risks because they could be used by the Chinese government to spy on users. Huawei has repeatedly denied its products are a security threat. Huawei’s Rotating Chairman Eric Xu revealed the numbers in a New Year’s message to employees and customers in which he also forecasted 2020 to be a “difficult year’, saying that the firm was unlikely to grow as rapidly as it did in the first half of this year. Its estimate of 18% revenue growth in 2019 is less than 2018, when Huawei’s annual revenue rose 19.5%. The company did not break down fourth-quarter figures but according to Reuters calculations based on its previous statements, revenue in the quarter to end Dec. 31 rose to $23.28 billion, up 3.9% from a year earlier and slower than the 27% increase it reported in the third quarter.
