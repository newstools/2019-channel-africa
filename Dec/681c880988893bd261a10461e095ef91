Khune has played just two matches in 2019, and in the second of those he only lasted 27 minutes, as injuries have taken their toll. He would not go into the details of what is hindering his return, but it could be that he needs to shed some pounds after so much time on the sidelines. “I just want to say that the club released the statement two weeks ago declaring that I am match-fit but again there were challenges I needed to overcome, and I cannot really disclose those challenges,” he told East Coast Radio. “But I have been training with the team. I have been slowly getting back into the mix. “I have been battling with other challenges which I cannot disclose. It’s because people are going to quote me on that next time I am out injured.” He was also full of praise for those who have been between the posts in his absence. “I have to give credit to Daniel Akpeyi, Bruce Bvuma, Brylon Petersen and goalkeeper coach Lee Baxter for having done well in my absence.” Chiefs are next in action on December 22 when they travel to Maritzburg United, defending their 10-point lead at the top of the Absa Premiership table. --AllAfrica--
