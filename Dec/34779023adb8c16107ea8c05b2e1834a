Marry Mubaiwa, 38, who is the wife of Vice President Constantino Chiwenga, was taken into custody on Monday after appearing in court to face charges of fraud, money-laundering and attempted murder of her husband. She was arrested by Zimbabwe's anti-graft commission on Saturday and was initially detained on suspicion of contravening the country's Exchange Control Act and of fraud. Mubaiwa appeared in a Harare court on Monday and was held pending a December 30 hearing. She did not speak at the court but her attorney told local media they would apply for bail. Prosecutors said between 2018 and May 2019, Mubaiwa withdrew amounts from her foreign currency account in Zimbabwe to deposit into bank accounts in neighbouring South Africa under the pretext of paying for goods bought in that country. She allegedly used part of the money to buy a house in the Waterkloof Golf Estate in the South African capital Pretoria and two luxury cars. Prosecutors accuse Mubaiwa, a businesswoman and former model, of attempted murder while she accompanied her husband when he was airlifted for medical attention in South Africa. In South Africa, she allegedly took the ailing Chiwenga to a hotel, refusing to take him to hospital until his aides forced their way and took him to a clinic.
