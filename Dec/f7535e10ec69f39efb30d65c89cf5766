Kanya Cekeshe was sentenced to eight years in prison in 2017 for public violence and malicious damage to property during the #FeesMustFall protest that hit South African universities a year earlier. Mr Cekeshe was freed after President Cyril Ramaphosa gave him a "special remission". Thousands of other prisoners were also freed following the president's intervention ahead of Christmas. In a statement, human rights organisation Section 27 said: "Kanya must now be allowed to rebuild his life, resume his education and make a positive contribution to society." --BBC--
