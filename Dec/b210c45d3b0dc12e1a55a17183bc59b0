Melchior Manirakiza, a businessman in the northern city of Ngozi, told BBC he didn't believe it was true when he first heard the news from contacts on WhatsApp until he had a go and saw for himself. "It wasn't possible to open it - until Sunday it was a nationwide cry-out and people were lamenting. We don’t know what's going on." Burundi's telecoms regulator hasn't replied to BBC on this matter. Users say they still can't access YouTube. Félicité Muganwa, a university student in the capital Bujumbura, told the BBC she hopes the shutdown will be a one-off because she depends on YouTube a lot. Burundi's government recently enforced a shutdown on the YouTube comment section of independent news outlet Nawe, accusing it of "rumour mongering" and "abusing the culture". The authorities have also claimed that some YouTube channels are run from neighbouring Rwanda with the aim on tarnishing Burundi's image. After Google, YouTube is believed to the second-most visited website in Burundi. This comes a few months before the presidential elections which are scheduled for May.
