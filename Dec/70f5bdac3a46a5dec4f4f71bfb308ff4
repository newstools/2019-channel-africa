The best estimate says the storm, named Pawan, will reach south of Puntland region near Eyl. It has winds of up to 75km per hour (47 miles per hour), but itâ€™s expected to weaken as it approaches land. The seas are reported to be rough currently and fishermen have been advised to stay away from the waters off the coast of Somalia for the next two days. Rainfall is forecast to intensify before subsiding once the storm arrives on land. Unusually heavy rains have been pounding most of eastern Africa for weeks now causing floods and landslides. The downpours have been caused, in part, by something caused a positive Indian Ocean Dipole - where the waters in the western side of the Indian Ocean are warmer than usual and those warmer waters have enhanced rainfall in East Africa. Adverse weather conditions in recent weeks have already killed more than 100 people and displaced hundreds of thousands across the region.
