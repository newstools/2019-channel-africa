“The government would take on salient factors that are holding back the potential of our enterprises; particularly with regard to taxes and tax administration, reduction or where possible elimination of fees or charges levied by government agencies as well as the private sector”, Kenyatta said. “To address some of these challenges, I order and direct that the National Treasury and the Kenya Revenue Authority review our tax structures, especially in relation to small businesses, so as to reduce the tax burden while fostering tax-compliance,” he said. He promised less bureaucracy and more simplification of processes in trade, access to credit and streamlining of consumer protection. --TheEastAfrican--
