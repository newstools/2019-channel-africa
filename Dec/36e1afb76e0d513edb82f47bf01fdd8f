The three-day walk will start from Galamba in central Uganda to Birembo in the west. A group of veterans and young Ugandans are participating in the walk to remember their heroes, according to a statement by the president's press secretary Don Wanyama. "It is hoped that the trekkers will cover between 15-20 miles per day before breaking in the evening over a bonfire where the President and other veterans will address the trekkers about Uganda’s liberation journey with emphasis on the role of various organisations including The Front for National Salvation (Fronasa) and the National Resistance Movement (NRM),” said the statement quoted by the Daily Monitor newspaper. Fronasa was a Ugandan rebel group led by Museveni that was founded in 1971 and fought alongside military groups to overthrow then-leader Idi Amin. NRM is the ruling party in Uganda and was founded as a liberation movement. This will not be the first time that the president is leading a walk, on December 4 he took civil servants, ruling party members and police officers on an anti-corruption walk through the capital, Kampala.
