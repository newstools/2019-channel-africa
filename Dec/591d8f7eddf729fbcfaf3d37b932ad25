The prioritisation of sport codes is likely to lead to a focused approach, in terms of support towards development and producing results.  It will also increase the level of competitiveness and performances by the local teams and athletes at various levels. Sports Commission director-general, Prince Mupazviriho, said the process has begun with national associations submitting their 10-year-development plans, which will guide them on the sport codes to be prioritised. “We are currently doing our assessment because we have requested every national association to give us their 10-year development plan and the cut-off date for that is today.” “And, it is going to inform us in terms of the level of development for each sport code and we then look at the competitive advantages we have vis-a-vis whether they are getting some investment from their international federations or not”,  said Mupazviriho. He noted that they would also look at various levels of competition and what they offer. “We will then also look at which are the sport codes which are also played at regional, at continental and at international level,’’ he said. --Herald--
