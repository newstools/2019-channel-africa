Nadal started the season recovering from ankle surgery, and struggled to get going, even taking some time to start winning on clay. However, he finished the season incredibly strongly, winning two Grand Slams and finishing the year as the oldest ever year-end world number one. "It has been a little bit of a magic year because it had been a good start, but then I went through a couple of very hard months in terms of injuries," Nadal told reporters in Dubai. "Then I came back and I came back well. I started to play at a very high level again.” “I enjoyed a lot of great moments on court, very emotional ones, Roland Garros, Rome, then New York, that final was amazing. And then of course ending the season with that Davis Cup title on home soil, so an unforgettable experience to finish that way." Nadal's preparations for 2020 are set to step up a gear on Friday, when he takes on Hyone Chung, at the Mubadala World Tennis Championship. --News24--
