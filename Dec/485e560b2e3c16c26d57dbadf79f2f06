Labuschagne, who was born in Klerksdorp, has scored 1 022 runs to date in 10 matches at an average of 68.13. Trailing Labuschagne, by 149 runs, in the Test run-scorer charts is former Australian Captain, Steve Smith, who is currently on 873 after 7 matches. Smith returned to Test cricket in August this year after facing a one-year ban from international cricket for ball tampering during the Test against the Proteas in Cape Town, South Africa, in March 2018. Australia still have one more Test remaining for the year, when they host New Zealand in their second Test on Boxing Day in Melbourne. --News24--
