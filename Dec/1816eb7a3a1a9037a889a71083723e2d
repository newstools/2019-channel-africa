The oil and gas major said the three appraisal wells drilled in 2019, GTA-1, Yakaar-2 and Orca-1, encountered 160 meters of net pay, a measure of a reservoir's thickness. In November, the Orca-1 well offshore Mauritania, partly owned with Kosmos Energy and Société Mauritanienne Des Hydrocarbures et de Patrimoine Minier, was further deepened and encountered more gas. “We have identified a large prospective area with considerable resource potential in Southern Mauritania. We will now conduct further appraisal drilling to help inform future development decisions,” said Howard Leach, BP’s head of exploration.
