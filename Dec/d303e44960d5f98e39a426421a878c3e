Now she is mocked and ignored. Her fall - from being the eyes and ears of one of Africa’s most repressive governments to a neighborhood punchline - illustrates how Ethiopia’s once ubiquitous surveillance network has crumbled. “My work is harder now,” she said, wistfully. “People don’t listen anymore.” Rahmat worked for a system set up by the ruling Ethiopian People’s Revolutionary Democratic Front (EPRDF) coalition in the early 2000s, officially to help implement central policies across the country of 105 million people. But the system, which detractors say was twisted into a tool to silence government critics, began to unravel with the outbreak of deadly protests in 2015 which undermined the EPRDF’s authority. The election of reformist Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed, who has vowed to make society more open and took office in April 2018, has accelerated its decline. That has been welcomed by many. “People were afraid and could not speak up,” said Agenagnew Abuhay, Rahmat’s colleague at a local women’s affairs office. Others, like Rahmat, mourn its loss, saying the network drove advances in health, education and agriculture.
