Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern said reconnaissance flights showed no signs of life on White Island, as eyewitnesses detailed the horrific burns suffered by survivors, most of them tourists. “The scale of this tragedy is devastating,” Ardern said in parliament. “To those who have lost or are missing family and friends, we share in your grief and sorrow and we are devastated.” Police said 47 people were on the island at the time of the eruption, 24 from Australia, nine from the United States, five from New Zealand, four from Germany, two each from China and the United Kingdom and one from Malaysia. “I would strongly suggest that there is no one that has survived on the island,” Police Deputy Commissioner, John Tims, said of the eight people still missing. Of the injured, at least 27 suffered greater than 71% body surface burns, and some could succumb to their wounds, said Peter Watson, the government’s chief medical officer. Burns units across the South Pacific nation of 4.5 million are full to capacity, he added.

Later, in parliament, she paid tribute to the pilots of four helicopters that landed on White Island in the aftermath of the eruption to bring out survivors. Australian Prime Minister, Scott Morrison, said three Australians were feared to be among the confirmed fatalities, with 13 among the injured. “I fear there is worse news to come,” Morrison said. Malaysia’s high commission in New Zealand said one Malaysian was among the dead. Britain’s high commissioner to New Zealand, Laura Clark, confirmed on Twitter that two British women were among the injured in hospital.
