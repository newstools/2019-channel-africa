They were captured in the Kalehe region in South Kivu province, which borders Rwanda in the east of DRC, army spokesperson, Maj Jean Louis Tshimwang, told reporters. Those captured included members of the the Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Rwanda and the National Liberation Front. Earlier in December, the Congolese army announced that it had captured 1 000 rebels in South Kivu. Rwandan rebels settled in DRC after the 1994 genocide in Rwanda and never returned.
