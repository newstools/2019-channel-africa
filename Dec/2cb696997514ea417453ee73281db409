The Supreme Court of Appeal ordered the Department of Education to pay Michael Komape's family just over 1m rand $70 000 for emotional shock. The court overturned the ruling over a lower court, which dismissed the family's case against the Department of Education in 2019. Human rights group Section27 fought the campaign to achieve justice for Michael's family. His death in 2014 caused outrage in South Africa, and drew attention to the lack of proper toilets in many schools. An estimated 4 500 schools out of a total of 25 000 have pit latrine toilets. Michael was a student at Mahlodumela Primary School in the province of Limpopo when he went to the toilet and never returned. The Department of Education denied responsibility for his death.
