Rescue workers say they can hear voices under slabs of concrete. Officials say the building housed 57 single rooms. Correspondents describe chaotic scenes with a huge crowd and under-equipped rescue workers. "All efforts are being made in order to rescue those who are trapped," Regional County Commissioner, Wilson Njeaga told the BBC. He said police were the first to the scene on Friday morning, before the disaster recovery unit of Kenya's Defence Forces took over. The collapse happened in Embakasi, an area of the capital where similar incidents have happened before. There have been major concerns over the poor quality of many structures in Nairobi where building regulations are often flouted. --BBC--
