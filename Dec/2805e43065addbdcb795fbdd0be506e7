The Cape Cobras duo of fast bowler Dane Paterson and opening batsman Pieter Malan, the Lions trio of batsman Rassie van der Dussen, fast bowler Beuran Hendricks and all-rounder Dwaine Pretorius, and Warriors wicketkeeper/batsman Rudi Second have all been included in the Proteas squad which will assemble for a training camp later this week. Second was selected for the previous Test series in India but had to withdraw through injury. Paterson, Van der Dussen, Hendricks and Pretorius have all represented the Proteas in white ball internationals. The first Test match takes place at SuperSport Park, Centurion, from December 26 to 30 and the second at Newlands from January 3 to 7. Lungi Ngidi of the Titans and Wiaan Mulder of the Lions could not be considered because of injury while Aiden Markram of the Titans is recovering well from injury. “The high number of uncapped players coming into the squad is a reflection of our policy to acknowledge players who do well at franchise level and have put their hands up for selection,” commented CSA Independent Selector, Linda Zondi. “Van der Dussen, who is third on the current four-day batting averages, and Pretorius, who has established himself as the leading all-rounder, are clear examples of this.
