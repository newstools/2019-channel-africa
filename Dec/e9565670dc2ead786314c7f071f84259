Amadou Toumani Touré was met by large crowds at the airport and outside his home on Sunday, RFI reports. The French-language broadcaster quoted well-wishers at the scene, calling Touré "the father of Malian democracy" and an "exemplary president". He had been hailed for ending years of military rule and handing power to civilians after organising elections in 1992, before going on to win the presidency ten years later.
