While the first-up Test series against England undoubtedly represents the premier business of their looming tour here, the two white-ball formats (three ODIs and three T20 internationals) immediately afterwards will also be of extra interest with next year's ICC T20 World Cup in Australia in mind. In that respect, the race has certainly begun for berths in the Proteas' plans - and especially in the top-order batting slots. They are critical positions in the game's shortest international version, given how often the top three are the likeliest to be able to play suitably lengthy innings: it is very common for all batsmen from number four down in a line-up to effectively have to play roles as finishers rather than have any luxury of playing themselves in to a meaningful extent. Getting selection right at one, two and three, then, is a vital element of a successful team brew: they are the players tasked with not only setting a strong platform but also ensuring a suitably rollicking tempo in the first-six-overs powerplay. As things stand, and with the ongoing Mzansi Super League a clear illustration, South Africa have increasingly fierce competition for those berths. Of the leading runs-scorers in the competition so far, five of the top six performers statistically (Englishman Liam Livingstone the odd man out, as he has more regularly batted at four for the Cape Town Blitz) can be branded specialists in top-three positions in the order. The pile is headed by Janneman Malan, the crisp-striking right-hander with the Cape Town Blitz, pleasingly only 23 years old and the sort of relatively new face South African cricket badly needs.
