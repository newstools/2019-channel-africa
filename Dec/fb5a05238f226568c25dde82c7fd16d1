Hillary Mutyambai urged more vigilance in places of worship as well as on public transport. The announcement comes a day after suspected members of al-Shabab, a Somalia-based jihadist group, kidnapped four construction workers in north-eastern Kenya. "We have made remarkable success in the fight against violent extremism, radicalisation and terrorism. However, the threat still remains. We must therefore be cautious of our respective surroundings and report any suspicious or unusual activities to security agencies, for action," Mutyambai said He called on religious leaders to liaise with police stations for additional security and for public transport operators to screen passengers and luggage. Police officers have been recalled from leave to boost security for the next two weeks, he said. Al-shabab has carried out attacks across Kenya, including the capital, Nairobi. The last major attack was staged in January at the Dusit hotel complex in which 21 people died. --BBC--
