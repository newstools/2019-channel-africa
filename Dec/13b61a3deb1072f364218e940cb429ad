The 31-year-old left Pro14 side Ospreys in 2018 to join Toulon on a three-year contract, which ruled him out of selection by the national team. In October 2017 the Welsh Rugby Union (WRU) changed its policy to make players based outside Wales with fewer than 60 caps ineligible for selection. “I’m really looking forward to the challenge and fighting for the Ospreys jersey again. I have loved my time in Toulon but it’s a relief to come home to the Ospreys, it’s where my family are, where I was brought up,” Webb, who has 31 caps, said. Webb also said in a statement on Toulon's website that he would give his all for the remainder of his time there. “It was difficult for me to be away from my family and my young children. From now on, I am determined to give my best for the club until the end of the season and I hope that we will obtain the victories that the club deserves.” --Reuters--
