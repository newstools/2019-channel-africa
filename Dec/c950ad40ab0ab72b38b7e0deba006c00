Kuria, who met with Europe's aviation watchdog on Wednesday, said: "I wouldn't even use the word trust anywhere near Boeing." Boeing is fighting for its reputation while the 737 Max remains grounded. A company spokesperson said: "The safety of passengers and crews flying on our aircraft is our absolute priority." He said: "We are truly sorry and we continue to offer our deepest sympathies to the families and friends who lost loved ones in the accidents of Lion Air Flight 610 and Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302. We know we have a deep responsibility to everyone who flies on our airplanes to ensure that the 737 Max is one of the safest aircraft ever to fly." Kuria met with European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) along with other family members who lost loved ones, to gain reassurances that the Boeing 737 Max will not return to the skies until rigorous tests are carried out. The British woman's father, Joseph Waithaka, died with 156 others on board an Ethiopian Airlines flight in March.
