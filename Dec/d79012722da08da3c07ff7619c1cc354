The South African Human Rights Commission (SAHRC) says it will meet with officials from government and various other stakeholders to chart the way forward regarding the integration of refugees and asylum seekers into South African society. Hundreds of refugees in the capital, Pretoria, and in Cape Town in the Western Cape province, have demanded that the United Nations High Commission for Refugees (UNHCR) relocate them to other countries due to what they say are fears of xenophobic violence in South Africa. The refugees camped outside the UNHCR offices before they were removed. Last week, the UNHCR announced that states pledged more than $3 billion to support refugees and about 50 000 resettlement places. UNHCRâ€™s Filippo Grandi said at the time that the Global Forum on Refugees had broadened responsibility-sharing for 25.9 million refugees who have fled war and persecution, mainly exiled in poor neighbouring countries. --SABC/Reuters--
