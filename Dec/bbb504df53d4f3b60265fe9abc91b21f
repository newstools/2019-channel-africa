Mbalula, who addressed the media on Monday at the Beitbridge border post after he released road crash figures for the festive season, said speeding and drunk driving are some of the contributory factors to road fatalities. He says 589 people have died in road crashes since the start of the festive season. Meanwhile, traffic volumes heading into the Kwa-Zulu Natal are expected to peak at the various toll routes today as holiday makers head to the province. Metro Police Spokesperson, Parbhoo Sewparsad, says the joint traffic operation centre, in partnership with the South African National Roads Agency Limited, will be monitoring the roads closely. In Gauteng, the provinceâ€™s Community Safety Department has expressed concern about the high number of road fatalities as well as incidents of drinking and driving on the province's roads at the weekend. --SABC--
