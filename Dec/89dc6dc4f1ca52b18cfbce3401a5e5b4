The Ministry of Mines and Mining Development had this year set a gold delivery target of 40 tonnes buoyed by the strong showing in the preceding year where miners had managed to haul 33,28 tonnes of the yellow metal. The 40-tonne target had been seen as a precursor to the 2023 milestone in which the Ministry is targeting annual gold deliveries to top 100 tonnes per year thus feeding into the US$12 billion mineral exports target. But this year’s target has fallen flat due to a myriad of challenges chief among them erratic power supplies and inefficiencies at exclusive State buying entity, FPR, which has seen some miners opting to offload their produce on the parallel market. The return in the first 10 months, January to October 2019, signifies a 23 % decline compared to the same period in 2018 in which the State buyer had managed 30.03 tonnes. 2018 went on to register record deliveries with FPR managing 33.2 tonnes.
Of note in this year’s statistics is that small-scale miners continue to deliver much more than their counterparts in the primary production sector having contributed 63,3 % of this year’s return. In an interview, Zimbabwe Miners Federation (ZMF) president Henrietta Rushwaya said the decline is largely due to two main factors which if Government does not act on, could scupper the 2023 milestone. --Herald--
