The statistics under review are for the capitalâ€™s eight major hotels, Crown Plaza Monomotapa, Rainbow Towers, Meikles, Cresta Oasis, Cresta Jameson, Cresta Lodge, Bronte Hotel and Holiday Inn Harare. Players in the sector say the country continues to suffer heavy negative publicity, but new engagements and re-engagements with foreign countries by Government are likely to see the impact being reversed in the long run. The decline in hotel nights is a major concern for government which has earmarked tourism to play a key role towards the revival of the economy together with other strategic sectors like mining, agriculture and the manufacturing sector. HAZ has said their hope was this trend will be stopped in 2020. Key destinations like the Eastern Highlands, Masvingo and Kariba, which are key destinations on the Zimbabwean hospitality and tourism circuit, are performing below optimal levels, with only the Victoria Falls continuing to lead the way. --Herald--
