The South Sudan pound has been weakening against the dollar since September after the payment of several months of salaries in arrears. “The pound has lost value in the past two months due to the impact of the recent payment of salaries,” said Central Bank Governor Dier Tong. About $115.2 million or 31 % of the currency in circulation was injected into the economy for the payments. The government secured $400 million financing from the Africa Export-Import Bank in October to pay the salaries and finance infrastructure projects. The managing director and CEO of Co-operative Bank of South Sudan Elijah Wamalwa said the high liquidity in the market would stoke inflation without the Central Bank’s intervention. Foreign businesses operating in South Sudan have traditionally faced challenges in repatriating profits or honouring contracts, at one time forcing Uganda to intervene on behalf of its traders. “South Sudan is in high need for dollars for importation and the likes. If you have high demand and low supply for dollars, then the prices will go up as there is a lot of money in the economy,” he said, adding that the mopping up of the South Sudan pound would stem a likely devaluation. He called on the Central Bank to mop up extra cash from the economy through instruments like Treasury bills and Treasury bonds. --TheEastAfrican--
