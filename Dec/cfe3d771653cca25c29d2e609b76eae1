The President Cup has never run without the involvement of at least one of Woods or Couples in one role or another, and at Royal Melbourne this week they will team up for the seventh time in the United States (US)’s cause. 

The pair was playing team mates in 1998 at Royal Melbourne when the US tasted their one and only defeat to the International team. Thirteen years later, with Couples in charge as captain, Woods rolled in the winning putt at the sandbelt course. 

The wheel has turned full circle in 2019, with Couples reporting to Woods as an assistant this week as the 15-times major champion becomes only the second playing captain in the history of the tournament. 

Both have had their bumps and bruises through long careers in the sport but their friendship has only strengthened through two decades of dominating the biennial team tournament, which the US have won 10 out of 12 times. “He is a heck of a captain, which you would think, and he’s a great player to be on your team, so we have both. It’s fun to see him in action, and he’s one of my favorite people in the world. So it’s really an honor to be his assistant.” 60-year-old Couples told reporters of Woods on Wednesday.
