According to The Guardian, the Blues will pursue the Ivory Coast international with the attacker eager to test himself at the highest level once more. The Blues are reportedly keen to give the 27-year-old that chance after having their transfer ban halved last week. Chelsea head coach Frank Lampard is expected to bring in a few new recruits into club in the New Year as the London club aim to build on their solid start to the season, which has been boosted by qualification for the knockout stages of the Uefa Champions League. Zahaâ€™s transfer value has continued to rise since an ill-fated spell at Manchester United where he managed a mere four appearances. A return to Selhurst Park has rekindled his career and Zaha now feels that he should test himself at a big club once more, having narrowly missed out on joining Arsenal in the latest transfer window. In total, Zaha has scored 55 goals in 340 games for the Eagles.  --AllAfrica--
