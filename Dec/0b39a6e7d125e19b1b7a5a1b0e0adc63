The five-time Ballon d'Or winner leapt into the air at an incredible 2.56 metres with a hang-time of 1.5 seconds to score a decisive header in the 45th minute to send Juventus to the top of the Serie A table. The 34-year-old is showing no signs of slowing down and has now scored six goals in Juve's last five games while scoring in each of the last five games. In comparison in Michael Jordan's legendary "free-throw dunk", Jordan reached a height of 1.038 metres with a hang time of 0.92 seconds. Juventus coach, Maurizio Sarri, was left stunned by the goal and had to use expletives to describe Ronaldo's winner in a post-match interview. Â "I think the amount of time he spent in the air before the header was incredibly long. A wonderful, physical and technical action." Sampdoria coach, Claudio Ranieri, said: "Ronaldo did something that you see in the NBA (National Basketball Association), he was up in the air for an hour and a half! There's nothing you can say about it, you can only congratulate him and move on."
