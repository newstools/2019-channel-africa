In a statement, UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres extended his deepest sympathies and condolences to the families of the victims and wished a speedy recovery to those injured in the blast. "He stressed that the perpetrators of this horrendous crime must be brought to justice," a statement by his spokesperson said. Saturday's blast was the worst attack in Mogadishu since the devastating 2017 bombing that killed hundreds. Police officer Mohamed Hussein said the blast targeted a tax collection centre during the morning rush hour. The explosion ripped through rush hour as Somalia returned to work after its weekend. At least 125 people were wounded, Aamin Ambulance service director Abdiqadir Abdulrahman said. Hundreds of Mogadishu residents donated blood in response to desperate appeals. "The explosion was very large," an eyewitness said. "It was close to where the 2017 bombing happened." "I saw many bodies lying on the ground. In my eyes, some of the dead were police officers, but also students were killed." President Mohamed Abdullahi Farmaajo condemned the attack as a "heinous act of terror" and blamed the al-Shabaab armed group.
