An FDLR Spokesperson, who goes by the alias of Curre Ngoma, told BBC Great Lakes that the Congolese military was “boasting of capturing him in an operation” but Nshimiyimana was arrested after a tip-off that he was in the city for a medical check-up. The spokesperson said that those who arrested Nshimiyimana were “not the Congolese army”, and added that he may have already been transferred to Rwanda’s capital, Kigali. He said the rebel movement “was not deterred” by his capture and that their fight would continue. There are reports of the Rwandan military being involved in the operation against the FDLR, but both governments deny it. Earlier, Congolese Army Spokesperson, Maj Ndjike Kaiko said Nshimiyimana was captured on Monday night and that he would be transferred to Rwanda. The rebel fighter is said to have been the second-in-command of an FDLR elite unit. Over the past few months, the Congolese army has intensified operations against rebel movements in the east. Some FDLR members are accused of taking part in the Rwandan genocide 25 years ago. --BBC--
