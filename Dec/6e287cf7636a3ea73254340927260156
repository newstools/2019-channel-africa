Howley returned home from Japan shortly before the World Cup began in September after the WRU became aware of possible wrongdoing. "Howley was withdrawn from his duties with Wales ahead of the 2019 Rugby World Cup as soon as the WRU became aware of a potential breach of regulations and an investigation was immediately launched," said a statement from the governing body. "The suspension is backdated to the time of his initial withdrawal from the World Cup, on the 16th September 2019, meaning Howley would be free to return to the game on or after 16th June 2020." In the written decision released by the WRU, it is revealed Howley was charged with placing 363 bets on rugby union over a four-year period, using accounts with three different bookmakers held in his own name. Howley "received the proceeds (or part of the proceeds) of the successful bets" and the former Wales and Lions scrum-half accepted the charge "without qualification". The WRU's policy and integrity manager Jeremy Rogers was contacted by an employee of Betway, who said Howley had placed bets on Wales games. At a September meeting to explain the process for the investigation it was noted Howley was "visibly upset" and said: "I'm putting my hands up. If I was being evasive, I wouldn't have used my works mobile phone and email account".
