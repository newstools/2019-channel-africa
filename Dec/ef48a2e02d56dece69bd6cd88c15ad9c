Two years later, he knows enough to work as a museum guide, a job he was trained for by the charity Sama for All. The charity, founded in 2017, works with two of Paris's to part galleries to train migrants and refugees as guides as part of a French drive to strengthen ties between refugees and locals after a surge in new arrivals. On Tuesday it was awarded 1 million dollars as part of the Bridge Builder Challenge run by the GRH Foundation, a U.S. philanthropic organisation that helps forcibly displaced people around the world. The foundation's chief executive Amy Goldman said offering cultural training to new arrivals helped lower social barriers as well as improving their career prospects. "Culture is so elusive for a newcomer to understand in a new country," she told the Thomson Reuters Foundation by phone from Rome. "By training newcomers to be art interpreters, they're shifting the narrative around who can be considered an expert in cultural spaces." France had 6.5 million immigrants in 2018, nearly 10% of the population, according to national statistics. The number of asylum claims last year rose 22% to 123Â 000. In January, French President Emmanuel Macron launched a programme to give community service jobs to 500 young refugees. However, the European Parliament warned in August that refugees in France still faced problems accessing the labour market either because they have no experience in the country or because qualifications gained elsewhere are not recognised. Conde said the six-month programme had given him a better understanding of France and, crucially, a foot on the career ladder in his new country. --Reuters--
