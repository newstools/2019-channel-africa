Over the previous two days, the Walkers Association of Uganda had covered about a third of the distance on foot to their destination in the eastern district of Kamuli. On its regular outings, the group - not your average bunch of fitness fanatics - raises awareness about climate change and plants trees on stopovers at schools, markets and factories, as well as denuded land and roadsides. “For us, walking is not just a form of physical exercise - it is a tool we use to advocate against climate change,” said Geoffrey “Walker” Ayeni, 41, a member of the group since 2007. In 2017, the association decided to add climate activism to its goals. The move came after 30 000 people were displaced by floods in the east of the country, some of them hit by landslides in the Mountain Elgon region along the Kenyan border. In March 2016, Uganda had recorded its highest temperatures in decades at close to 38 degrees Celsius (100.4 Fahrenheit), according to the national meteorological authority, followed by a long dry spell. “I couldn’t just sit and watch,” said Ayeni. He kicked off the campaign by walking almost 320 km alone, from Kampala to Kapchorwa in eastern Uganda, to draw attention to climate change. Along the way, he delivered petitions to district governments, calling for environmental protection. “I felt like it was our moral duty to do something; to move across the country and tell people about climate change and encourage them to adopt healthy practices like tree-planting,” said Ayeni, clutching his beaded walking stick in the colors of the Ugandan flag.
