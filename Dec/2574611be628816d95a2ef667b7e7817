According to the Cricinfo website, Steyn injured his side playing for the Cape Town Blitz in the recent Mzansi Super League (MSL) on December 1. He was scheduled to play the Blitz's final MSL match against the Tshwane Spartans on December 8, but that match in Centurion was washed out. After arriving in Australia earlier this week the Stars opted not to play the star Proteas speedster in their opening match against the Brisbane Heat on Friday, instead setting him for the clash against Hobart Hurricanes on Sunday in Moe. "Our priority is Dale's fitness and continuing his treatment," Melbourne Stars physiotherapist Tommy Simsek said. "He is very keen to play, but we'll let him rest after a long flight to Australia and put him in the best position to be ready for our match in Moe on Sunday." Steyn is only available for the first half (roughly six matches) of this year's BBL before he'll be replaced by 21-year-old English paceman Pat Brown. Steyn was in terrific form for the Blitz in this year's MSL, finishing as the third-highest wicket-taker (15 in 8 matches), only two scalps fewer than spin duo Imran Tahir (17 in 11 matches) and Tabraiz Shamsi (16 in 10 matches). However, the 36-year-old's form wasn't able to see the Blitz qualify for the playoffs as they finished a disappointing fifth in the six-team tournament. Steyn won't be part of the upcoming Proteas v England 4-Test series having announced his retirement from the five-day format earlier this year. He is, however, expected to be included in the Proteas' ODI squad for the three 50-over matches that will follow, starting on February 4, as well as the two T20s from February 12 onwards. The 2019/20 BBL, the ninth instalment of the hugely popular tournament, will run from December 17, 2019 to February 8, 2020. The Melbourne Renegades are the defending champions.
