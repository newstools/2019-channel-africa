On an entirely different sporting canvas, the same nation’s athletes are taking their sporting world by storm, in what the experts are calling “the South African cyclone”. For the past five years the World Surf League’s Championship Tour (CT) has been dominated by what’s been known as ‘the Brazilian Storm’. 

In fact, until five years ago, and since South African Shaun Tomson won the surfing world title in 1977, an Australian or American has won 30 out of 36 world titles, with Hawaiian’s claiming another five. Then came the Brazilians, who have won three of the last five. 

With mere weeks to go before the 2019 World Surfing champion will be crowned, three of the four title contenders are Brazilian. Surfing’s Championship Tour is possibly one of the toughest of all sports, where only 36 surfers make it onto the 11-contest world tour each year. 

All others who aspire to that level need to pay their own way to journey the year-long Qualifying Series (QS), which is a series of non-stop events held across the globe. 

No matter how far a surfer has travelled, if they lose in the first-round, in a 25-minute heat, they pack their bags and travel (alone) to wait for the next event. It’s a brutal, expensive and lonely game - which the surf world calls ‘the grind’. Because it is one, it grinds people down, drains money and delivers disappointment in abundance. The only antidote is resilience, to keep grinding away.
