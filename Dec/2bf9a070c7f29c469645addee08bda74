Other people were reportedly badly wounded in the violence in Adjumani district, which began on Wednesday after a local man died, AFP says. Some people then suspected a South Sudanese refugee of killing him. "Armed with arrows and machetes, the host community attacked the refugee settlement villages," district commissioner Peter Dana told AFP. "The police and the army have deployed in the refugee camp and the surrounding areas to stop the violent clashes and calm has been restored." More than one million South Sudanese refugees live in Uganda, which has been praised for its hosting policies. According to AFP more than 200 000 South Sudanese refugees live in the district where this attack happened.  --BBC--
