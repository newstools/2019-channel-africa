The Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) has a 20%stake in the plant some 60 miles (100 km) southeast of Lagos. California-based Chevron, which is trying to sell some Nigerian assets in an effort to focus on its fast-growing United States production, did not immediately comment. The 33 000 barrel-per-day (bpd) plant, which produces synthetic diesel, liquefied petroleum gas and naphtha from natural gas using technology from South Africaâ€™s Sasol, cost around $10 billion to build, four times the original estimate, and its start-up in mid-2014 was years late. --Reuters--
