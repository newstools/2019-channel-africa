Nineteen people, including the missing two, were killed by the eruption. The missing two have been named as Hayden Bryan Marshall-Inman who was a local tour guide and Winona Jane Langford, an Australian tourist.  Marshall Inman, who was 40, was last seen alive but beyond help by a helicopter pilot shortly after the eruption. Lanford, who was 19, was on a day trip from a cruise ship, had her parents killed and her brother seriously injured and is among 25 people still being treated in hospital. Last week, Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern said the official inquiries by coroners and work safety regulators into the eruption could take up to a year. "As I have said many times, there remain now questions to be asked, and questions to be answered. â€œAs you know, on December 10, WorkSafe opened a health and safety investigation into the harm and loss of life caused by the eruption. WorkSafe can prosecute for breaches of the act and penalties in criminal sanctions range from $50 000 to $3 million and up to five years in prison." The tragedy is expected to bring changes to the country's thrill-seeker tourism industry. --Reuters--
