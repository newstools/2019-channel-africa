The protests were sparked by soaring bread prices in the central town of Atbara and swept across the country and by April had toppled Bashir. He had been in power for three decades. The celebrations have been organised by the transitional government and the protest movement as tribute to the thousands of demonstrators who propelled the uprising, the AFP news agency reports. In the capital, Khartoum, celebrations are planned in several districts, particularly at the city's Freedom Square, which was renamed in honour of the protesters, the AFP adds. The military and the main opposition coalition signed a constitutional declaration in August, which paved the way for the formation of a power-sharing government and ended months of unrest. A governing body of six civilians and five generals was set up to oversee a three-year transition period.
