The meeting was initially scheduled for 17 October but was postponed. The diplomatic feud started after both countries traded accusations of interference in each other's affairs. A Memorandum of Understanding signed by Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni and Rwandan President Paul Kagame in Luanda, Angola, in August has failed to ease tensions. Rwanda closed its border with Uganda in March and has restricted movement of goods and people across the two countries. Uganda's government spokesperson Ofwono Opondo tweeted on Thursday that today's meeting will be attended by delegations from Angola and Democratic Republic of Congo - who are the facilitators of the agreement. Opondo said all the delegates confirmed participation in the meeting. --BBC--
