More than 30 people have been rescued so far from the rubble in the Nairobi suburb of Tassia, but there are fears more are still trapped. The six-storey building collapsed on Friday and the emergency services are still searching for people who are trapped. Some families are still waiting for their relatives who are unaccounted for and feared to be under the rubble. Area administrator James Wanyoike told the BBC that rescuers have gone through five floors and still have to search the basement, where children are believed to have been trapped in a video game store. --BBC--
