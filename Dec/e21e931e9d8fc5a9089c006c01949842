"Our democracy is what is at stake, the president leaves us no choice but to act," the top elected Democrat said. She spoke a day after the House Judiciary Committee began considering potential charges against the Republican president. Trump told Democrats to move quickly if they were going to impeach him. The California congresswoman told Thursday morning's news conference: "The facts are uncontested. The president abused his power for his own political benefit at the expense of our national security, by withholding military aid and a crucial Oval Office meeting in exchange for an announcement for an investigation into his political rival." She added: "Sadly, but with confidence and humility, with allegiance to our founders and a heart full of love for America, today I am asking our chairmen to proceed with articles of impeachment." Democrats are keen to hold a vote on impeachment in the House of Representatives before the end of the year, with the prospect of a trial in the Senate perhaps as early as January 2020. On Wednesday, Pelosi held a behind-closed-doors meeting on impeachment with her fellow Democrats and asked them: "Are you ready?" The lawmakers responded with a rousing "Yes", according to the Associated Press news agency. --BBC--
