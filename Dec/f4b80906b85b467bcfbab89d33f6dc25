South African President Cyril Ramaphosa, at a media conference last week Wednesday, announced that sabotage had contributed to recent load shedding. The president had cut short an official visit to Egypt short to return the South Africa after Eskom took the unprecedented step of introducing stage 6 load shedding due to an acute shortage of capacity. "Someone in the Eskom system disconnected one of the instruments that finally led to one of the boilers tripping," said Ramaphosa. Hawks spokesperson Hangwani Mulaudzi confirmed to Fin24 on Wednesday afternoon that the matter had been referred to the priority crimes body for investigation. The case has been referred to the Hawks to investigate allegations of tampering with, or damaging essential infrastructure and sabotage," he said.Â
