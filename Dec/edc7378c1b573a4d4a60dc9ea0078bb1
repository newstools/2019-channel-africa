The aim is for a global stock of 500 000 doses of vaccine against the deadly haemorrhagic fever, GAVI said in a statement. The stockpiling will start with Merckâ€™s newly developed Ervebo vaccine, which won regulatory approval last month. The plan is for poor and middle-income countries to be able to access the stockpile free of charge, GAVI said, while other countries will need to refund the cost of any vaccines used. GAVI is a public-private partnership backed by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, the World Health Organisation, the World Bank, UNICEF and others, which arranges bulk buys to reduce vaccine costs for poor countries. --Reuters--
