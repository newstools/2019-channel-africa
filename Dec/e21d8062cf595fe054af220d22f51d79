After 18 months in charge of the Gunners, Emery's reign at the London giants ended abruptly last month. Arsenal legend, Freddie Ljungberg, has taken over on an interim basis as the club board searches for a replacement. 

Meanwhile, the Toffees also parted ways with Marco Silva last week and subsequently entrusted club legend, Duncan Ferguson, to keep an eye over the first team on an interim basis. 

In his first outing as Everton's coach, the former striker guided the Blues to an emphatic 3-1 victory over Premier League giants Chelsea in front of a roaring home crowd. However, the Everton board are committed to not handing the reigns over to Ferguson on a permanent basis. 

The club have been rumoured to have four candidates in mind for the vacant managerial post. Everton are back in action on Sunday as they travel to Old Trafford for a Premier League clash against Manchester United.
