Speaking at the Nato summit near London, Macron also demanded more international help with the mission, which France has led for five years. Thirteen French soldiers died in a helicopter crash in Mali last week. Macron said he wanted a clear commitment from the G5 Sahel group - an alliance of African nations - that the French mission was welcome and an end to carping by African politicians. He invited the five leaders - from Burkina Faso, Chad, Mali, Mauritania and Niger to a summit on December 16 in southern France. --BBC--
