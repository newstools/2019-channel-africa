At 0150 GMT the Nikkei index was up 1.02% to 23,531.85, led by gains in the industrial sector and the consumer discretionary sector. So far this year the index is up 16.38%. Japanese shares started brightly in reaction to government data released Friday that showed improvement in China’s vast manufacturing sector, suggesting Beijing’s stimulus measures are starting to support growth. Shares extended gains after a separate survey of China’s manufacturing sector was revised up to show the fastest growth in almost three years, but an ongoing trade war between the United States and China remains a risk to the outlook. There were 205 advancers on the Nikkei index against 18 decliners on Monday.
