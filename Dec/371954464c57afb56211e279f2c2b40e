A department investigating state corruption in Botswana alleges that they set up bank accounts in Hong Kong and South Africa in order to finance terrorism. All the accused have denied the allegations and at a news conference in South Africa, Khama described them as wild claims that were part of a state-sponsored smear campaign. Since stepping down last year, Khama has accused current President Mokgweetsi Masisi of betraying the country and reversing policy decisions, including lifting a ban on elephant hunting. --BBC-
