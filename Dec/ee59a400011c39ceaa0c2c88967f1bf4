Party leader Duma Boko told a press conference in Johannesburg that the High Court in Botswana has been petitioned and that a hearing would take place in the next few days. President, Mokgweetsi Masisiâ€™s Botswana Democratic Party (BDP) won the election by securing 38 of the 57 parliamentary seats despite party infighting. The UDC obtained 15 seats. BDP Spokesperson, Kgalalelo Kentse told the BBC that the poll was free and fair and that President Masisi won legitimately. Kentse also said that the BDP was a law abiding party which would allow the High Court to make its findings and called on all parties involved to respect the outcome of the court. --BBC--
