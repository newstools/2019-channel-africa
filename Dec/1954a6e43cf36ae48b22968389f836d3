Cameroon is among the countries witnessing more cases of measles, amid a global epidemic. Dr Phanuel Habimana told the BBC that not enough children are being vaccinated. In order to stop measles spreading, 95% of children need to get the two doses of the vaccine. But he said only 71% of children were vaccinated in Cameroon in 2018. Over the last week Cameroon's vaccination programme for the second dose for children between nine months and five years old has been enlarged. Across the world more than 140,000 people died from measles last year as the number of cases around the world surged once again, official estimates suggest. The five worst-affected countries in 2018 were Democratic Republic of Congo, Liberia, Madagascar, Somalia and Ukraine. Most of the lives cut short were children aged under five. The situation has been described by health experts as staggering, an outrage, a tragedy and easily preventable with vaccines.
