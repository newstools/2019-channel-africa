United States-China trade optimism and reassuring economic data from China had driven Asia and the main emerging market stocks index to 18-month highs overnight, but the greens immediately turned red when London, Frankfurt and Paris opened. The FTSE 100 .FTSE, which had seen its best day in nearly a year on Monday, dropped 0.2% and the United Kingdom's domestically focused mid-cap index .FTMC plunged 1.6%, after reports UK PM Boris Johnson would use his control of parliament to ban any extension of the Brexit transition beyond 2020. The pound GBP=D3 fell 1% to back below $1.32 and nearly 2% under Thursday and Friday's post-election highs of over $1.35. The broader European STOXX 600 dropped 0.6%, hurt by a profit warning from consumer goods giant Unilever (ULVR.L) that sent its shares down nearly 6%. “So much for pragmatism,” J.P. Morgan’s Malcolm Barr said, referring to reports of Johnson’s hard-line Brexit stance. “We have put the risk of a no-deal end to the transition at 25%, a number we regard as uncomfortably high.”
