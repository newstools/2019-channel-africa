Both unions have called on the department to engage with labour. This comes after Public Enterprises Minister, Pravin Gordhan, announced plans to radically restructure South African Airways (SAA). The dominant unions at SAA, NUMSA and SACCA have responded to a statement issued by the department of Public Enterprises. Both unions say they reject notion that the week-long strike is responsible for the national carriers deteriorating financial position. NUMSA says SAA management knew, from as early as June 2019, that the airline wouldn’t have enough money for operations and to pay salaries. While SACCA on the other hand has called for South African Airways to begin a process of rooting out corruption at management level – saying it is crucial for the survival of the national carrier. SACCA president, Zazi Nsibanyoni-Mugambi, however, claims that the SAA leadership may be protecting corrupt elements. "Someone needs to commit to the fact that they are going to deal with corruption. We have a measure in place, which is the task team that can hone into these issues. We had a restructuring officer from the UK at 6 million a month and did absolutely nothing. We believe SAA is still corrupt." 

"With corrupt management and leadership, where are we really going? That needs to be dealt with. There seems to be a protection of certain corrupt forces which we don’t take lightly to. Who are going to be on the firing line – our members."
