He will also speak about the outcomes of law enforcement operations at a media briefing at the Beitbridge border post in Musina, in the Limpopo province. Prior to the briefing, Mbalula will tour the Beitbridge border post between South Africa and Zimbabwe to assess the cross-border operations during the festive season when traffic volumes are expected to be high. His spokesperson, Ayanda Allie Paine, says the idea is to assess the cross border operations at that port of entry. “You will know that this time of the year traffic peaks exceptionally there and the traffic volumes are expected to be quiet high”, she adds. Further, Allie Paine says the Beitbridge border post is one of the busiest commercial entries among all the borders that link South Africa with its neighbouring countries. --SABC--
