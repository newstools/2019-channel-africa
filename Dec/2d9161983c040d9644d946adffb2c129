From the early hours of Wednesday morning, a heavy deployment of police was visible around Camp Nou, where Barca will host Madrid in the season's first Clasico at 21:00 (SA Time). Police were also stationed outside the nearby Hotel Princesa Sofia, with players, coaching staff and referees instructed to gather there and then leave together for the match two hours before kick-off. Around 3000 security personnel will be posted around the stadium after renewed fears of unrest. The original fixture in October had to be postponed due to violent demonstrations breaking out across Catalonia. "We know we are living in a complex social and political situation but I am convinced that it is compatible with playing a football match," said the club's president Josep Maria Bartomeu last week. Democratic Tsunami, the protest group advocating another independence referendum for Catalonia, has called publicly for its supporters to gather at Barcelona's Camp Nou stadium from four hours before kick-off. Barcelona newspaper La Vanguardia claimed there were plans to throw inflatable balls onto the pitch to denounce the use of rubber bullets by police during the October riots. "Tsunamis are like water, they adapt to and adopt ideas," read a message posted on Twitter by Democratic Tsunami account on Wednesday morning. "We accept the #ChallengeLaVanguardia and call on everyone to throw an inflatable ball and write a message to the world."
