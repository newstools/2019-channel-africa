Rescue workers say the three-storey building fell down killing at least five people and injuring several others. The building, comprising of homes and several shops, collapsed on Monday evening trapping a number of people including children. Emergency workers spent several hours trying to pull out those trapped in the rubble as hundreds of people gathered around. They used an excavator, simple digging tools and even their bare hands. A Red Cross official in Jos told the BBC that the owner of the building and two of his children were among the dead. The victims were taken to hospital. It is not known why the structure came down, but previous buildings collapses in the country are often attributed to a disregard for building regulations. --BBC--
