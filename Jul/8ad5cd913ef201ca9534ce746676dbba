President Hassan Rouhani announced that after July 7 Iran would enrich uranium beyond a fissile purity of 3.67%, which is the maximum allowed by the deal and a level which is deemed suitable for electricity generation. It is the second time this week that Tehran has announced a measure that undermines the nuclear accord, which has been in trouble since Trump pulled the US out of it in 2018. “Our level of enrichment will no longer be 3.67. We will put this commitment aside by whatever amount we feel like, by whatever amount is our necessity, our need. We will take this above 3.67,” said Rouhani, according to IRIB news agency. Enrichment to 90% yields nuclear bomb-grade material. Trump responded with a post on social media, saying: “Iran has just issued a New Warning. Rouhani says that they will Enrich Uranium to ‘any amount we want’ if there is no new Nuclear Deal. Be careful with the threats, Iran. They can come back to bite you like nobody has been bitten before!” Experts said Iran has no legitimate use for uranium enriched beyond the level permitted by the deal. “There is no justification,” said Kelsey Davenport of the Arms Control Association, a Washington advocacy organization. The move, she said, was aimed at increasing pressure on European powers, China and Russia to compensate Iran for the impact of US sanctions re-imposed by Trump after he renounced the deal. “These are political decisions to increase leverage. They are no indications that Iran is about to dash to a bomb or pursue nuclear weapons,” Davenport said. Tehran has denied any intent to develop nuclear weapons.
