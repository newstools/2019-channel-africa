Interbank Burundi denied the accusations in court in the capital, Bujumbura, on Wednesday. Last week in Bujumbura, two officials of Trust Merchant Bank of the nearby city of Uvira in DRC were arrested with $1.5 million (£1.2 million) in cash from Interbank Burundi on their way to Uvira. During Wednesday's court session, the state prosecutor accused Interbank Burundi of making illegal foreign currency transactions with Uvira’s Trust Merchant Bank that endangered the Burundian economy. The prosecution said it was investigating reports that the cash was being channelled to finance militia groups in eastern DRC. Interbank Burundi denied the allegations, saying it was playing a routine, intermediary role to facilitate money transfers between Trust Merchant Bank Kinshasa and its Uvira branch. The court in Bujumbura is to give its verdict in 10 days. --BBC--
