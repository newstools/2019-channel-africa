The ruling came in response to a complaint filed on behalf of victims demanding one billion shekels, $280 million in compensation, according to a justice ministry statement. The amount is to be decided by the court at a later date, it said. The Palestinian Authority refused to participate in the case at Israel's Jerusalem district court and it is unclear how the judgement would be enforced. Late Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat and Marwan Barghouti, serving five life sentences in an Israeli jail for allegedly organising a series of killings of Israelis, were also held responsible by the court. "It is a historic victory that finds that the Palestinian Authority is responsible for attacks during the second intifada," said lawyer Nitzana Darshan-Leitner of Israeli NGO Shurat Hadin, which represented the victims and wages legal battles worldwide against what it calls "Israel's enemies." The second Palestinian intifada, or uprising, lasted from 2000 to 2005. In November 2017, an Israeli judge ordered the Palestinian Authority and perpetrators of a deadly 2001 attack to pay $18 million in damages to relatives of those killed. --AFP--
