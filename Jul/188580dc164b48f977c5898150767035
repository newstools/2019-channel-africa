This comes after 10 Turkish sailors were kidnapped off the coast of Nigeria earlier this month. The International Maritime Bureau (IMB) says the Gulf of Guinea is the most dangerous sea in the world for piracy. A total of 73% of all sea kidnappings and 92% of hostage-takings occur in the Gulf of Guinea off Nigeria, Guinea, Togo, Benin and Cameroon, according to the IMB. The agreement will enable West African countries to jointly use facilities vessels and aircraft to better monitor the coast.
