Zimbabwe is experiencing a serious shortage of foreign currency and is struggling to pay for essential imports including fuel, wheat, drugs and electricity. Average weekly output has gone down by about 50 % while normal mining cycles involving extraction and development on new pits have been badly affected, chairman of Coal Producers Association Ray Mutokonyi told Business Weekly. Zimbabwe has three coal producer, Makono Resources, the largest in terms of output, Hwange Colliery Company and Zambezi Gas, supplying a combined 80 % of their output to Zimbabwe Power Company, a production unit of Zesa Holdings. “We do have other challenges but diesel shortages is the biggest challenge,” Mutokonyi, who is also a director at Makomo Resources said. “On average, we need about 1,5 million litres of diesel per week but we are getting slightly below half.” Producers were mainly concentrating with mining at the existing pits while development of new ones have been put on hold. --Herald--
