The news provided support for the oil market but gains were capped by stubborn demand jitters linked to the weak global economic outlook. Britain repeated its demand that Iran release the Stena Impero, which the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps seized on Friday in the strategic Strait of Hormuz. "Traders are clearly a little on edge due to the importance of the passage for global oil supplies," remarked Craig Erlam at the Oanda brokerage. "Oil prices haven't risen too much yet but if the situation deteriorates further, we should possibly brace for higher prices," he added. In Libya meanwhile, authorities said that output at the Al-Sharara oil field had resumed, ending a three-day suspension owing to "sabotage" of a pipeline. The suspension had added to upward pressure on crude prices. In afternoon deals, London Brent oil had gained 1.1% and New York crude was up by 0.9%. Higher oil prices underpinned the share prices of energy companies, which in turn, helped guide most European stocks indices to higher ground. In New York, the Dow Jones Industrial Average added 0.1%as trading got underway. --AFP--
