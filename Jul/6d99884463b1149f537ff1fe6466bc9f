She was taking part in a sit-in near the Defence Ministry in Khartoum on June 3 when security forces stormed in. The area had become a center for anti-government protests. Saleh said she was beaten with sticks, and still wears bandages on her wounds. “I came back from a safer place because I want a better future for this country,” the 41-year-old said. Women were a driving force during months of protests against President Omar al-Bashir’s 30-year rule, before he was replaced by a military council in April. But the protests didn’t stop as demonstrators demanded the military swiftly hand power to civilians, leading to a stand-off and then a crackdown. Nahid Gabralla, a 53-year-old activist, said she was beaten and threatened with rape during the June 3 raid. “Sudan can be better,” she said. “My daughter deserves to live in a nice country.We will fight for a democratic Sudan, real change and for our rights.” Physicians for Human Rights, a US-based group that investigates rights violations, cited local medics as saying women had their clothes torn off and were raped, though the sexual violence was hard to quantify. Local women’s activists, citing multiple eyewitness testimonies, said soldiers held up women’s underwear on poles to symbolize the women they had sexually assaulted. --Reuters--
