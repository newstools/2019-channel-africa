The 30-year-old hit 65* (43) to help the Vancouver Knights chase down the 160 runs they needed for victory against the Toronto Nationals in just 17.2 overs. Van der Dussen, who was one of South Africa's standout performers at the 2019 World Cup, was one of three South Africans taking part in the match. In Toronto's innings, Heinrich Klaasen made 41 (20) to top score for his side, while allrounder Andile Phehlukwayo finished with figures of 1/30 (4) for the Knights. Van der Dussen has broken through as one of South Africa's key batsmen in limited overs cricket and he will almost certainly be a part of the squad that travels to India in September for three T20Is. He has also put his hand up to be included in the Test squad that will take on India in a three-match series in October that will serve as South Africa's first participation in the Test Championship.
