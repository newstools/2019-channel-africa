According to South Africa’s Sowetan newspaper, after students at Nelson Ngobeni Primary School complained about stomach pains on Monday afternoon and started to vomit, they were taken to hospital. Two of the children died on the way, another in hospital. “There are currently about 10 learners from the same school who are being treated at Emalahleni hospital," said Jasper Zwane, a spokesperson from Mpumalanga’s Department of Education. He said an investigation had begun and the province’s education minister is expected to meet parents later. --BBC--
