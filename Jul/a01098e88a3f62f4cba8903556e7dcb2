Nike has withdrawn a pair of special edition trainers because it allegedly features racist symbolism. The shoes are emblazoned with the country's "first flag", which was created during the American Revolution and is adorned with a circle of 13 stars representing the original colonies of the United States. It was later adopted by American Nazis. Nike asked retailers to return the special edition trainers. But, some managed to make it into the outside world with people bidding more than $214 a par on line.
