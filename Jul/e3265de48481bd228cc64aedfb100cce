Hiring new client relationship managers and perhaps making acquisitions in a few years’ time can help fuel growth, said Claudio de Sanctis, head of wealth management Europe and chief executive of Deutsche Bank (Switzerland) Ltd. The division is targeting entrepreneurs and rich families in core countries such as Germany, Italy, Britain and Spain as well as largely untapped markets in Eastern Europe. Wealth management is seen as a growth area after a major restructuring announced on Sunday by Germany’s largest bank that will chop 18 000 jobs and scale back its investment banking operations. “It is not necessarily known but we already are among the biggest wealth managers in Europe in terms of assets. That will be helpful in terms of being credible with European entrepreneurs,” de Sanctis said in an interview. --Reuters--
