The 32-year-old Scotsman, who could become the first Wimbledon men's singles champion since Michael Stich in 1992 to win the doubles title, returned to tennis only a fortnight ago after what he called life-changing hip surgery. He and Herbert, who has won all four Slam doubles titles, gelled as the match went on and beat Romanian Marius Copil and Frenchman Ugo Humbert 4-6, 6-1, 6-4, 6-0.
