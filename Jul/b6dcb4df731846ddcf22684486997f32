Malinga will play his final one-day international in Colombo Friday in the first of three one-day internationals against Bangladesh, although he hopes to continue playing in the shorter T20 format. "I think he is a great ambassador of this game," Tamim told reporters Thursday in Colombo, adding that Malinga's achievements were "extraordinary". "Tomorrow is a special game for him. But one thing is for sure - when we play against him we will not keep it in our head that it will be his last match and will try to play as hard as possible. "We will try to win the game for Bangladesh." Malinga said Thursday he was "very happy" to make way for younger players after calling time on his illustrious 15-year career in the 50-over format. "I am very happy to leave at this time. This is an opportunity for new players to prove themselves and prepare for the next World Cup," Malinga, 35, told reporters at the team's final training session. "We may have had some setbacks, but we have the capability to win another World Cup," he added, pointing to Sri Lanka's success at the 1996 World Cup and 2014 T20 World Cup. Malinga known for his trademark blond-highlighted mop and piercings - called on cricket administrators to be patient with up-and-coming stars and let them develop ahead of the next ODI World Cup. --News24--
