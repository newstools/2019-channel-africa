Busisiwe Mkhwebane is South Africa's Public Protector, a position with a constitutional mandate to investigate public corruption and misconduct but is viewed by some as an ally of graft-tainted ex-President Jacob Zuma who appointed her before he was ousted. On Sunday President Cyril Ramaphosa said he would take Mkhwebane to court over a report that found he had misled parliament about a donation to his campaign fund. On Monday, the Constitutional Court dismissed Mkhwebane's bid to scrap a 2018 High Court ruling ordering her to pay $65 000 in legal fees for a different report the judges had found to be biased. The highest court said Mkhwebane had been "deceitful" and acted in "bad faith" in an investigation involving local bank Absa, whose predecessor Bankorp had received an illegal lifeline from the central bank during the apartheid years. She had ordered the country's anti-graft Special Investigation Unit to recoup about $80 million from the new, democratic-era Central Bank. "The Public Protector's entire model of investigation was flawed," the Constitutional Court said in its judgement. "She was not honest about her engagement during the investigation," it found and concluded: "this type of conduct falls far short of the high standards required of her office." --AFP--
