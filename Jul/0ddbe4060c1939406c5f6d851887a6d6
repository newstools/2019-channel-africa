South Africa were paired against the hosts on Tuesday after qualifying as one of the four best third-placed teams in the tournament. Despite talk that the home team are overwhelming favourites in this epic encounter, Bafana will look back at history with lots of pride. South Africa enjoy a healthy record against the Pharaohs in previous encounters. Stuart Baxter’s side will look to make their own history by upsetting the tournament favourites in their own backyard. Bafana resumed training on Wednesday, where coach Baxter hinted he might beef up in some areas which have not been functioning at 100% in the tournament so far. Looking far more relaxed, Baxter said if the team gets its tactics right, they have the potential to give the Egyptians a good run for their money, come Saturday. While Egypt will rely on the vociferous home crowd support to spur them on, the same crowd can also put pressure on the home team if things don’t go the way they would like to. It is the weight of the expectations that Baxter can take advantage of, with critics arguing, if Bafana Bafana can hold on in the opening minutes of the game, the big crowd can actually put lots of pressure on the home team; something the visitors can exploit. Kick-off is at 21:00.
