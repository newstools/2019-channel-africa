The 29-year-old Race to Dubai leader drew the ire of golf fans everywhere after berating his caddie on more than one occasion during the final round of the European Tour event in Germany a couple of weeks ago. It wasn't the first time Wallace had rubbed fans the wrong way with his on-course behaviour, after also being forced to apologise for his "petulance" during the final round of the British Masters at Hillside, and drawing criticism from Sky Sports commentator Rich Beem during the US Open at Pebble Beach. While Wallace ignored the social media furore that broke out immediately after the latest incident, he finally broke his silence at the Irish Open last week, vowing to do better going forward. "I spoke to Dave straight away after we finished on 18 and we spoke about the situation," Wallace told the Irish Independent. "I said let's not let this affect us going forward because he wasn't happy with how he performed as well, so I said let's move on from this, are we good? And he was, like, absolutely. So we hugged it out and moved on. "The two times I've been in with a chance to win tournaments I've reverted back to how I used to win tournaments and that was to be intense, pretty much too much over the top. "I used to do that on my own whereas now I've got a caddie and stupidly I've probably blamed him where I need to take full responsibility for what I did there - and I know that. It's something I am working on.‚Äù He added: "I am not proud of how I dealt with that situation and I have definitely addressed it and moved on. Just because I haven't said anything on social media doesn't mean I haven't addressed it with my team. --News24--
