It is a "historic moment" for the country, the deputy head of Sudan's ruling military council, Mohamed Hamdan "Hemeti" Dagolo, is quoted as saying by AFP news agency. Sudan has been in turmoil since the military ousted President Omar al-Bashir in April. Protesters have been demanding the military hand power to civilians. Those protests turned deadly in a crackdown on 3 June which left dozens of protesters dead. They have agreed to rotate control of the sovereign council - the top tier of power - for just over three years. That council will be made of five civilians, five military figures, and an 11th civilian, to be chosen by the 10 members. A military general will be in charge of that council for the first 21 months, and then a civilian will lead for the following 18 months, followed by elections. A second agreement on constitutional issues is expected to be finalised on Friday.
