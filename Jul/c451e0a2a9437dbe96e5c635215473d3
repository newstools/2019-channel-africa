Airtel Africa’s prospectus for the London listing shows the waiver was effected earlier in June, giving the subsidiary of India’s Bharti Airtel Ltd a breather as the Tanzania government continues to push telcos and mining firms to go public or face sanctions. This policy requirement, passed into law in 2016, saw the country’s largest telco, Vodacom Tanzania, list on the Dar es Salaam Stock Exchange in 2017. “In June, pursuant to settlement arrangements agreed on with the Tanzania government, Airtel Tanzania will receive a waiver of the listing requirement,” Airtel Africa says in the prospectus. In 2016, Tanzania passed regulations that required telcos to offer at least 25 % of total share capital on the DSE by December 31, 2016. Mining companies were also required to sell 30 % of their shares to local investors. --TheEastAfrican--
