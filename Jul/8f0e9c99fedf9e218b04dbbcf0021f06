The General says 12 officers and four soldiers have been arrested.

The announcement came as the ruling military and civilian protesters agreed last week to end a political impasse after the army in April ousted Omar al-Bashir on the back of a popular uprising.Â 

General Jamal Omar of the ruling Military Council did not say when the attempt was made. The announcement late Thursday came as the generals and protest leaders went through the details of the agreement at a hotel in Khartoum. --AFPTV--
