Journalists flocked to the court where the trial of the 24 suspects reopened for what could be its last day, in a case that shocked the North African country. Prosecutors have called for the death penalty for the three main jihadist suspects behind the "bloodthirsty" murder of the young Scandinavians in December. The maximum sentence was sought for 25-year-old suspected ringleader Abdessamad Ejjoud and two radicalised Moroccans, although the country has had a de facto freeze on executions since 1993. Petitions on social media have called for their execution. The three admitted to killing Danish student Louisa Vesterager Jespersen, 24, and 28-year-old Norwegian Maren Ueland. The prosecution has called for jail terms of between 15 years and life for the 21 other defendants on trial since May 2 before an anti-terror court in Sale, near Rabat. The accused will be able to speak before deliberations, according to the lawyers. The life sentence has been sought for Abderrahim Khayali, a 33-year-old plumber, who had accompanied the three alleged assailants but left the scene before the murders. The prosecution called for 20 years in jail for Kevin Zoller Guervos, a Spanish-Swiss convert to Islam. The only non-Moroccan in the group, Guervos is accused of having taught the main suspects how to use an encrypted messaging service and to use weapons. His lawyer, Saskia Ditisheim, said Guervos' "most basic rights had been trampled" in a letter to the Swiss foreign ministry, regretting that he had not had "consular protection". --AFP--
