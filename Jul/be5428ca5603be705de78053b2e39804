Overall revenue missed analyst estimates. Revenue from NBCUniversalâ€™s cable networks, filmed entertainment and theme parks also fell short of expectations in the seasonally weaker quarter. Philadelphia-based Comcast is adapting to changes in consumer behavior as more people drop their cable television subscriptions in favor of streaming services like Netflix Inc (NFLX.O). Comcast said it lost 224,000 video customers in the quarter, more than the 121 000 it lost in the preceding quarter and topping the loss of 178 000 estimated by analysts, according to research firm FactSet. Revenue from the high-speed internet business grew 9.4% to $4.66 billion in the second quarter as Comcast gained 209 000 subscribers.

The net subscriber additions were slightly ahead of the average analyst estimate of 208 000, according to FactSet, but were down from 260 000 in the same period a year earlier.
