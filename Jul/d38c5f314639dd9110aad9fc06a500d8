It was reported that the arrest of Kabendera had caused upset in Tanzania where the hashtag #FreeErickKabendera had been trending on social media all day. Dar es Salaam Police Chief, Lazaro Mambosasa, insisted to Reuters that they are working with the immigration department and would probably file criminal charges after the investigation. Police sources told Reuters that Kabendera's family allegedly originated from a neighbouring country and he did not follow proper procedures for naturalisation.

Kabendera wrote in 2013 that the police had questioned his mother for 10 hours over her Tanzanian citizenship and had asked her to tell him that he "should 'stay quiet,' otherwise I would end up in jail". International media watchdog The Committee to Protect Journalists says that his arrest sends the message that journalists are not safe in Tanzania. Reporters Without Borders told AFP news agency that in their eyes the reason the police gave for the arrest "did not hold water". On Saturday, Kabendera had published a report in The East African newspaper about infighting within Tanzania's ruling party and apparent efforts to block President John Magufuli from running in 2020 elections, reports AFP.
