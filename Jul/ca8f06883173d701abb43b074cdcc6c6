Government initially pegged the producer price of raw cotton at $1, 95 per kilogramme, but prevailing high inflationary pressures have made the upward review necessary. Zimbabwe’s inflation rose to triple digit levels last month, with annual rate hitting 175, 7 % in June from 97, 9 % in May, according to ZimStats’ latest figures. Effective today (yesterday) our farmers will be getting $3 per kilogramme,” Cottco managing director Pious Manamike said. “The adjustment is necessary to cushion our farmers from high inflationary pressures and also taking into consideration that the US dollar equivalent (of $1,95) was quite high when we started buying.” At the beginning of the marketing season, the value of the Zimbabwe dollar was trading at around 3 to 1 against the United States dollar and yesterday, the rate was at 8,82 to the greenback. Cotton Producers and Marketers Association chairman Mr Steward Mubonderi commended the move by Cottco while urging farmers to deliver their crop to the company early. --Herald--
