News website, Times Live, reports that Mboweni relayed his decision in a letter to Communications Minister, Stella Ndabeni-Abrahams, late last month. The cash strapped SABC has prioritised salaries as it struggles with a mountain of debt following what analysts say are years of mismanagement. The country's Finance Minister reportedly cites government's fiscal constraints and that it cannot offer bail-outs unless the entity is financially viable. Mboweni has also expressed concerns about the SABC's high cost structure, including its salary bill.
