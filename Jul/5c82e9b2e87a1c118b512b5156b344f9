The airport authority added that the carrier companies will begin receiving passengers to complete the rest of their re-scheduled flights for the day shortly. Three Afriqiyah airlines employees were injured and a plane was hit. No immediate comment was available from the carrier. An airplane coming from Tunisia Carthage airport to Mitiga was redirected earlier Sunday to Misrata international airport that serves the Mediterranean coastal city of Misrata in Libya instead, after Mitigas air space shut down, according to the authority's Facebook page.
