Bafana Bafana only played one practise match ahead of the tournament in Egypt. 

This disrupted their plans for the Africa Cup of Nations (AFCON). 

However, goalkeeper Ronwen Williams believes that they have taken the tournament as preparation. 

He says as the team goes further, they are also starting to perform better than in the group stage matches. 

"Our preparation wasn’t good and the coach [Stuart Baxter] said last week maybe we using the tournament as preparation and you can see we getting much better. [During] our first game, we didn’t have a shot on target, against Egypt we created many chances, so we getting better. The further the tournament goes … we must remain humble and continue focussing."
