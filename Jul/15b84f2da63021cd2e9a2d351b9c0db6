Wall Street analysts and investors have raised doubts about demand and the Silicon Valley automaker’s ability to sort out recent delivery issues, particularly after a disastrous first quarter when deliveries slumped 31%. "We are increasingly comfortable that they should reflect an even better in the third quarter, and probably their first hundred thousand in a quarter," Roth Capital analyst Craig Irwin said. Tesla delivered 95 200 vehicles in the second quarter, beating analysts’ average estimates, but did not comment on when it would return to profitability. Shares of the company were up 6.4% at $238.92, their highest in nearly two months. Up to Tuesday close, the stock had lost nearly one-third of its value so far in 2019. --Reuters--
