According to the ICC website, a number of England and New Zealand players have moved up after featuring in an exhilarating final at Lord's, which saw England triumph in a Super Over. In the latest rankings update, which takes into account performances from the semi-finals and the final, players from both sides reached personal bests during the last two closing stages. Player of the tournament, New Zealand skipper Kane Williamson, who finished the tournament with 578 runs, moved up two spots to sixth in the batsmen rankings. England opener Jason Roy's 85 from 65 balls in the semi-final win over Australia helped him into the Top 10 for the first time (in 10th place). In the bowler rankings, England's Chris Woakes' efforts of 3-20 in the semi-finals and 3-37 in the final lifted him to a career-best 676 points and seventh place, just shy of the sixth-position he reached in April 2017. New Zealand seam bowler Matt Henry's consistency has taken him back into the world's Top 10 as he took three wickets in the semi-finals and one in the final. His previous best was fourth position in 2016. In the ICC ODI team rankings, England have increased their lead at the top of the standings over India to three points after their maiden Cricket World Cup triumph. --News24--
