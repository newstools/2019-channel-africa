Affonso has an impressive goalscoring record for Alianza Lima, scoring 19 times in 39 appearances and joins fellow South Americans Ricardo Nascimento, Jose Ali Meza and Gaston Sirino at the club. Alianza Lima confirmed the frontman's exit on their official Twitter page: "Thanks does not seem enough! We hope that in this new direction you take, you shine always as you did here, in our club," the statement read as translated from Spanish. "We wish you the best ‘Tank’, we are left with all your goals and the valuable quality of human being. Thank you, Mauricio."
