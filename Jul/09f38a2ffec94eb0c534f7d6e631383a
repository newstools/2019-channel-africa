The 19-year-old former SA number is moving on from a glittering amateur career after signing a multi-year agreement with PING, together with signing exclusive representation terms with Butler Bell Sports Ltd in the United Kingdom. Nienaber makes his debut in the Le Vaudreuil Golf Challenge in France, closing a chapter of his golf career that saw him win no fewer than 21 amateur titles, including the SA Amateur Championship at King David Mowbray Golf Club earlier this year. "My sincere thanks to Mr Johann Rupert and everyone involved at GolfRSA for guiding and supporting me to this juncture," he said. "I am looking forward to my career as a professional and working hard to achieve success." Nienaber climbed to the top of the amateur rankings in South Africa on the back of a stellar 2017, when he won 11 times, including three international events. In 2018, the teenager won four times and represented South Africa in the World Amateur Team Championships (Eisenhower Trophy) and retained the number one ranking despite a limited playing schedule in order to complete his education at Grey College in Bloemfontein. Just weeks after losing a playoff for the English Men's Open Amateur Stroke Play Championship (Brabazon Trophy) title at Frilford Heath, he was the leading qualifier at Royal Aberdeen and Murcar Links in the strokeplay portion of the Amateur Championship that year - the first South African to accomplish this feat since qualifying was introduced in 1983.
