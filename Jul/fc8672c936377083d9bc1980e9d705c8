In a tweet, the police spokesperson said that 111 officers were injured during the clashes. Protesters had blocked some of the country's main highways. The demonstrations followed the burial of a teenager of Ethiopian descent who had been shot dead on Sunday by an off-duty policeman. Demonstrators were complaining of marginalisation and victimisation. --BBC--
