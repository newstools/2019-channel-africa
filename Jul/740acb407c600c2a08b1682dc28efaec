The exact geographical location of the valve on the pipeline was not immediately clear. The field, which produces 290 000 barrels per day, was shut down for a few days on July 19 after an unknown group blocked a valve on the pipeline to Zawiya in the Hamada area in western Libya. The shutdown at the time prompted state-owned National Oil Corp (NOC) to declare force majeure on loadings of the crude grade. Prior to the shutdown, Libya was producing 1.2-1.3 million bpd, a six-year high for the OPEC member which has struggled to return to a pre-civil war capacity of 1.6 million bpd. NOC operates Sharara in partnership with Spain’s Repsol, France’s Total, Austria’s OMV and Norway’s Equinor. --Reuters--
