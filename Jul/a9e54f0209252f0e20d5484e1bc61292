Boeing, which has halted deliveries of the top-selling plane since mid-March, reported 239 commercial plane deliveries in 2019 through the year's midpoint, down 37 % from the year-ago period. Airbus reported 389 deliveries for the same period, up 28 % from the same period in 2018, according to data on its website. If the numbers hold throughout the year, Airbus could replace Boeing as the world's largest aircraft maker. Boeing's big decline in deliveries confirms the extent to which the 737 MAX crisis has dented its standing following two recent crashes that killed 346 people. Boeing in June again reported no new orders for the 737 MAX. Plane deliveries are tied to company revenues and closely monitored by Wall Street. Leading analysts have slashed their profit forecasts for Boeing due to the 737 MAX crisis, which has halted deliveries and forced the company to store planes after they are manufactured. --BBC--
