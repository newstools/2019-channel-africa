Mouad Bouchareb is the latest high-profile political figure to stand down after demands for his removal by anti-government demonstrators. The pressure from the streets in Algeria has continued since protesters forced the veteran president Abdelaziz Bouterflika to stand down three months ago. Still in the sights of the demonstrators are the leading figures of the country's ruling elite. The protesters have been chanting for the dismissal of what they call the three Bs including the interim president and the prime minister all of whose names start with a B. One of their number, Tayeb Belaiz head of the constitutional council stood down in April. Now, a fourth B Mouad Bouchareb has gone too, after many MPs demanded his resignation to try to quell public anger. But a clear path out of Algeria's political turmoil has yet to emerge. --BBC--
