Two other militants were jailed for 41 years each. The three had earlier been found guilty of conspiracy to commit a terrorist attack and of belonging to al-Shabab, which is linked to al-Qaeda. It was the second-deadliest attack in Kenya. The al-Qaeda bombing of the US embassy in 1998 killed more than 200 people. Rashid Charles Mberesero, who was given a life sentence, is a Tanzanian, while the other two men, Mohamed Ali Abikar and Hassan Edin Hassan, are Kenyans. Mberesero was given the longest term because he was arrested at the scene of the massacre and could not explain his presence, the court heard, the AFP news agency reports. The attack was carried out by al-Shabab at the north-eastern Kenyan university in April 2015. The trial has been beset by changes of magistrates and witnesses not showing up in court, a situation typical of the Kenyan justice system, the BBC reports. The three were eventually convicted last month. In the early hours of 2 April 2015, heavily armed attackers stormed Garissa University College and shot dead two security guards before aiming fire at students. The gunmen raided the campus, attacking students in their classrooms while they were preparing for exams. Witnesses said Christians were singled out by the militants and shot. --BBC--
