The law exempts from prosecution members of government forces and the rebel-turned-opposition group Renamo for crimes committed between 2014 and 2016. Renamo fighters and government forces were involved in clashes since disputed elections in 2014. Renamo has carried out a spate of attacks on civilians and government targets since the disputed election, as it insists on the right to govern six of Mozambique's 10 provinces. During this time, Human Rights Watch (HRW) said the two forces were involved in enforced disappearances, torture and killings. Mozambique's President Filipe Nyusi denies that the government forces committed any crimes. Given this, HRW question why he submitted the draft law to parliament. They also challenge the idea that the amnesty will promote peace, saying that four previous amnesties did not such thing. "Sadly, this law will do more than ensure impunity for past grave crimes. It will also likely pave the way for future abuses," said HRW.
