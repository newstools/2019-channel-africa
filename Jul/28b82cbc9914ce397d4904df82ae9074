At least 44 people died in what the US State Department earlier described as an abhorrent attack. During a two-hour closed-door meeting of the Security Council, Britain circulated a statement that condemned the air strike and called on the warring sides to commit to a ceasefire. But US diplomats told the meeting they required a green light from Washington to approve the text of the statement and the talks ended without agreement. It's unclear why approval wasn't forthcoming. The US has not called for an independent investigation but a State Department spokeswoman said the attack underscored the urgent need for all Libyan parties to end the fighting in Tripoli and return to the political process. In April, the US and Russia refused to support a UK-drafted resolution calling for a ceasefire in Libya. --BBC--
