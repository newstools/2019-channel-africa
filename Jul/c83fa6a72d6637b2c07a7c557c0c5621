Douglas Tapfuma, who last year was responsible for running the President's State residence, is expected to appear in court later on Wednesday. Local media is reporting that Tapfuma used letters from the president's office to import duty-free vehicles for friends and relatives. Last week, Zimbabwe's Tourism Minister, Priscah Mupfumira, pleaded not guilty after being charged with corruption linked to the disappearance of $94 million (Â£77 million) from the country's pension fund when she was Welfare minister.
