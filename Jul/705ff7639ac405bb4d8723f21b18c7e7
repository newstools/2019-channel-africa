Lorenzo Fontana, currently minister for the Family, takes over the post that had been handled on an interim basis for several months by Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte. It was Salvini, the eurosceptic leader of the far-right League party to which Fontana also belongs, who proposed Fontana to the post. Fontana, 39, is a close collaborator of Salvini. He is a devout Catholic opposed to abortion and to surrogate births. Fontana has served as a city councillor in his Verona, including a period as deputy mayor. He has also served as a deputy in the European Parliament. He will be sworn in later Wednesday along with his replacement as familiesâ€™ minister, Alessandra Locatelli, another member of the League party, said Conte. Eurosceptic economist Paolo Savona quit the post of European affairs minister in February to join Consob, the organisation that polices the Italian stock exchange. --AFP--
