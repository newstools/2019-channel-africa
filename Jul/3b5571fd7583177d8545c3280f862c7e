Hundreds of people wearing yellow T-shirts and waving yellow placards picketed parliament to protest corruption in Lungu's government.

"It is clear from these demonstrations... that our detractors have upped their game to trivialise the fight against corruption, to politicise the fight against corruption," Lungu said at the swearing-in of new commissioners for the country's Anti-Corruption Commission at State House in Lusaka.

The president said protesters want "to disrupt the successes that this government has scored," and to "paint my government black so that citizens turn against us".

In the address, broadcast live by the state-run Zambia National Broadcasting Corporation (ZNBC), Lungu accused protest organisers, including opposition party leaders, of using corruption allegations as an motive to trawl for financial assistance from international organisations.

"They believe the international community will listen to them and finance their campaigns when they scream the 'corruption, corruption' chorus," he said.

Lungu became president in 2015 after the death of president Michael Sata and was re-elected in 2016, but his administration has been dogged by accusations of graft.

The former minister for social services, Emerine Kabanshi, is due in court next month over allegations that led Britain to suspend aid to Zambia.
