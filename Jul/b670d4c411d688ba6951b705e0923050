Just two years after arriving from Everton in an initial £75 million deal, the 26-year-old is understood to be welcoming interest from the Serie A giants. Antonio Conte's side met United in recent days for discussions, but PA Sport understands that Inter has been struggling to fund a deal for the Belgium international. The striker missed Saturday's 2-0 friendly win against Perth Glory due to a knock and fuelled speculation about his future as he left Optus Stadium, telling reporters: "You guys will know something next week". And now Sky Sports claims that the Serie A side will make a 'new offer of £60 million($75 million) plus bonuses' for Lukaku on a permanent deal. Inter were hopeful of wrapping up an initial two-year loan deal for Lukaku with payments of £9m($11 million), £27 million($33 million) and £27 million coming over three consecutive years. However, it is understood that United had little interest in a loan deal this summer and wanted closer to the £75 million($93 million) they paid for him back in 2017. The Serie A outfit still hopes the new permanent offer will be 'structured over two or three years' and will include 'bonuses' on top of the £60 million($75 million) to try and meet the Red Devils' valuation.
