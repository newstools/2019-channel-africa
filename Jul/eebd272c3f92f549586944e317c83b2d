Tanzania’s National Bureau of Statistics this past week reported an inflation rate increase of 0.2 % from 3.5 to 3.7 % in May. NBS attributed this to an increase in food and non-food items plus prices of commodities. The overall index rose to 117.03 in June this year from 112.81 in June 2018.  The inflation rate for food and non-alcoholic beverages rose to 2.3 % in June this year, from 2.2 % in May. The inflation rate for food consumed at home and away shot up to 4.3 % in June, from 3.9 % in May, while the 12-month index change for non-food products maintained the 4.7 % rate from May. The consumer price index shrank by 0.2 % between May and June this year compared with a 0.4 % increase recorded between April and May. NBS attributed this to price drops for non-food items such as gas by 2.1 %, charcoal (by 2.8 %), mobile phones (3.7 %), handbags (0.5 %) and clothing (0.2 %). In Uganda, inflation rose by 0.1 % between May and June, from 3.3 to 3.4 %. The Uganda Bureau of Statistics attributed this to annual core inflation, which rose to 4.9 % for the year ending June 2019, from 4.6 % for the year ended May 2019. UBoS attributed this to annual services inflation, which rose to 4.7 % from 4.0 in May, while the annual inflation rate for education shot up to 6.8 % from 3.6 %. In Kenya, the consumer price index dropped by 0.69 % in June this year from 205.77 in May. Overall inflation stood at 5.70 % in June 2019. The Kenya National Bureau of Statistics said that favourable weather boosted food production leading to lower prices for some commodities. Over the same period, housing, water, electricity, gas and other fuels rose by 0.05 % as a result of increased house rents that overshadowed notable drops in the costs of electricity and kerosene. --TheEastAfrican--
