The announcement was made by chief negotiators on live television on Monday night and confirms reports from Friday that the two camps had made the agreement. The cabinet will consist of 66 members. These include Prime Minister Sylvestre Ilunkamba, who was proposed by Kabila, 42 positions will be held by Kabila's coalition and 23 will be held by Tshisekedi's alliance. Holders of the positions are yet to be named. It comes seven months after the Tshisekedi's CACH alliance won the election. Questions were raised at the time about the accuracy of the results amid accusations that Tshisekedi had made a pre-election power-sharing deal with Kabila. --BBC--
