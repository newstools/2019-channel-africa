The announcement on Thursday shows how a crisis brought about by sluggish sales and rising costs, is worsening at Japan's No. 2 automaker even as it tries to recover from a financial misconduct scandal surrounding ousted Chairperson, Carlos Ghosn. Nissan, which said the job cuts will be made globally by 2022, added that it will reduce global production capacity and its product line-up by about 10% by the end of fiscal 2022. The automaker had 138 000 employees globally as of March 2018. Its first-quarter operating profit plunged 98.5% to $14.80 million as it continues to struggle in North America, a key market where it has been stung by mounting costs of vehicle discounts to keep up with rivals. Years of heavy discounting to grow sales has left Nissan with a cheapened brand image and low vehicle resale values, while the costs to offer high discounts have hit its bottom line. Nissan had flagged a steep drop in profit on Wednesday. The dismal quarter will add pressure on Hiroto Saikawa, Nissan's embattled Chief Executive Officer (CEO), who has been tasked with shoring up the company's performance amid the Ghosn scandal. Ghosn has denied the charges of financial misconduct. The automaker is widening job cuts initially announced in May as it struggles to improve weak profit margins in the United States, where Ghosn for years had pushed to aggressively grow market share during his time as CEO.
