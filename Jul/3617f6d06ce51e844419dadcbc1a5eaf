In a statement they say they suspect that it capsized due to overloading adding that the vessel was overturned by heavy current. 

The passenger boat had been travelling from Ajah on Lagos Island to Ikorodu on the mainland when the incident happened. 

The state's Emergency Management Agency says three people have been rescued and have been taken to hospital, while the body of one of the passengers has been found. 

Many people in Lagos use the waterways to beat the heavy road traffic but water transportation is not fully developed. --BBC--
