The touring side took an unassailable four-nil lead in the seven-match series following four wins on the bounce. The sub-continent outfit posted a commanding 341/8 in batting-friendly conditions, with Rohail Nazir top-scoring with 89 off 91 balls (11 fours) before Bird (75 off 75 balls, 10 fours, 2 sixes) and Terblanche (53 off 65 balls, 7 fours) contributed in vain, towards South Africa’s reply of 253 all out in 43.3 overs. Naseem Shah (4/52) and Aamir Ali (4/44) were the pick of the bowlers for Pakistan en route to victory. After winning the toss and electing to set a score, Pakistan got off to another flyer with the bat. The opener, Haider Ali, smashed a quick-fire 59 off 41 deliveries (12 fours) in two half-century partnerships with Fahad Munir (56) and Nazir. 

After Ali was dismissed, Nazir took on the run-scoring mantle alongside Haris Khan (62), with the pair both reaching their half-tons. Although the home side fought back during the last ten overs, thanks in main to crucial wickets from Imraan Philander (3/52) to leave Pakistan on 279/5 after 44 overs, Khan and Abbas Afridi helped carry their side to well over the 300-run mark. The latter scored an unbeaten 30 off 19 balls to push the tourists to near 350. Faced with an uphill battle of 342 for victory and a way back into the series, South Africa made a solid start after a 116-run partnership for the second wicket between Bird and Terblanche. The pair looked dominant at the crease, with Bird dispatching the ball to all parts of the ground before another middle-order collapse hindered the hosts’ chase. The left-arm spinner, Ali made regular inroads, taking four scalps while Shah delivered effective yorkers to continue picking up wickets despite Bryce Parsons’ valiant 39 off 20 (5 fours, 2 sixes). Lifa Ntanzi (9) was the last wicket to fall as Pakistan got over the line with 6.3 overs to spare. With the series now decided, the fifth Youth ODI takes place on Tuesday, July 2 at the City Oval in Pietermaritzburg from 09:00.
