He then spent a season on-loan to second division club Union Saint-Glloise and impressed with netting 13 goals while adding the same number of assists during his time at the club. The player made quite a name for himself as he was crowned the Proximus Player of the Season. According to KickOff, Brugge, who ended second behind Genk in the in the Jupiler Pro League, are keen to sign the player. "Negotiations are ongoing, but sources close to the player say that [the move] is as good as done. He is loaned for a year, possibly with an option [to purchase] but that is not yet certain," the report stated. Meanwhile, Tau recently ended his 2019 Africa Cup of Nations campaign with South Africa in Egypt where he starred alongside Lebo Mothiba, Thembinkosi Lorch and Bongani Zungu. Tau has also been linked with a move to France where he could potentially play alongside his former Mamelodi Sundowns teammate Zungu at Amiens SC. The French side are keen to lure the player to the Ligue 1 since Saint-Gilloiseâ€™s coach Luka Elsner was recently announced as their new manager.
