Steinhoff first flagged holes in its accounts in December 2017, the warning shot for an accounting fraud since put at over $7 billion shocking investors that had backed its transformation from a small South African outfit to a discount furniture retailer spanning four continents. The owner of Mattress Firm Inc in the United States, Fantastic chains in Australia and Conforama in France said the loss from continuing operations came in at $400 million  in the six-months ended March compared with a loss of $441 million a year earlier. "Although corporate and treasury services costs were much reduced, the operational results for the period continued to reflect the knock-on impact of the announcement of accounting irregularities in December 2017," the retailer said in its 97-page half-year unaudited report. Advisory fees for the period amounted to $92 million. “While every effort is made to limit costs, we expect this to remain our reality for some time,” Steinhoff added. --Reuters--
