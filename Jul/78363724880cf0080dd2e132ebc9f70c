The Proteas lost five of their nine matches to limp to a seventh-place finish at the tournament and they failed to challenge for a place in the semi-finals. Gibbs, who was vocal on Twitter throughout the competition, believes the players should provide answers for what went wrong in England. The 45-year-old was speaking to media after the draft for the first ever Euro T20 Slam where he will be coaching the Rotterdam Rhinos. "The body language," he told Cricinfo when asked what aspect of the Proteas' performance disappointed him most. "A lot of people who were observing felt they weren't trying hard enough. "It was very disappointing to see how they went about things ... I don't think we expected them to lose so many games. "It was heartbreaking. There will obviously be a large enquiry as to what happened and it would be nice to hear some answers, maybe, from one or two of the players." The Euro T20 Slam gets underway on August 30.Â
