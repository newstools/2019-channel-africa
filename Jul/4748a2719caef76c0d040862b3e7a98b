FCA chief operating officer for Europe, Middle East and Africa, Pietro Gorlier, announced the investment - the Italian-American company’s biggest single bet on an electric vehicle - at its Mirafiori plant in Turin, northern Italy. "The plan is confirmed," Gorlier told reporters, when asked if FCA’s investment in electric vehicle technology would remain unchanged after its $35 billion plan to merge with Renault, an electric car pioneer, collapsed in June. He said FCA would invest the $788 million to build a new production line at Mirafiori to turn out 80 000 of the new 500 BEV, its first battery electric vehicle to be marketed in Europe. An initial version of the electric 500 has been produced in the United States to comply with local authorities’ push on zero-emission cars. But in 2014 former CEO Sergio Marchionne asked customers not to buy the car as FCA was losing money on it, and said he hoped to sell the smallest number possible. Production of the newly-engineered 500 BEV will start in the second quarter of 2020, with a potential to expand capacity later, Gorlier said. --Reuters--
