Ireland's GDP figures are often treated with caution due to the distorting effects of the business flows and accounting practices of multinational firms based in Ireland, especially United States companies. But gross national product (GNP) which excludes the profits of Irish-based multi-nationals grew by 6.5%, the Central Statistics Office said. The CSO said the surprising performance was due to an increase of more than 10% in the export of goods and services. Meanwhile personal consumption of goods and services, a key measure of domestic economic activity, grew by 3.4%. The size of the Irish economy was measured at $365 billion in 2018 using GDP. Using GNI, an measure intended to strip out the retained earnings of international firms headquartered in Dublin, it stood at $222 billion. Preliminary first quarter results for 2019 showed a 2.4% increase in GDP compared with the last quarter of 2018, while GNP was up 2.1%. The rise was also driven by exports and domestic consumption, said the CSO. The prospect of Brexit has left some Irish companies fearing the consequences in case of trade disruption with Britain, with which is shares a land border. --AFP--
