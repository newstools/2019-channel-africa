Aid agency, Action Against Hunger, identified a staff member and five others kidnapped last week in a video released on Wednesday. The video showed the kidnapped aid workers asking for help from the government and the international community to secure their release. On Thursday, the Nigerian government said it was negotiating with the captors, but declined to give further information. The Islamic State claimed responsibility for the attack in its weekly newspaper. The group split from Boko Haram in 2016 and has carried out a number of attacks in Nigeria's north-east and the Lake Chad region in the last few months, often targeting military bases. In October 2018 the group killed an aid worker it had kidnapped in March the same year. --BBC--
