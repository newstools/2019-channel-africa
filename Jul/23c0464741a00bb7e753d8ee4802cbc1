The former Blues midfielder inked a three-year deal with the London side where he won 11 major honours as a player, including three Premier League titles and two European trophies. "I am immensely proud to be returning to Chelsea as head coach," he said as quoted by the club's website. "Everyone knows my love for this club and the history we have shared, however, my sole focus is on the job in hand and preparing for the season ahead. I am here to work hard, bring further success to the club and I cannot wait to get started." Chelsea Director, Marina Granovskaia, added: "It gives us great pleasure to welcome Frank back to Chelsea as head coach. "Frank possesses fantastic knowledge and understanding of the club and last season, he demonstrated he is one of the most talented young coaches in the game. "After 13 years with us as a player, where he became a club legend and our record goalscorer, we believe this is the perfect time for him to return and are delighted he has done so. We will do everything we can to ensure he has all the support required to be a huge success." Lampard's first Premier League match as the club's new mentor will be against rivals Manchester United on Sunday, August 11.
