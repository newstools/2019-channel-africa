Two week’s ago Chasi said his government would pay a US$10 million debt to the South African power utility to ease power shortages. But by Friday last week, the money had not yet reflected in Eskom’s account. 

Eskom Chief Executive Officer, Phakamani Hadebe, issued a statement saying the power utility, which is owed a total of $33 million by its Zimbabwean counterpart Zesa, was yet to receive the money. “Eskom would like to state no funds have reflected on its accounts for Zimbabwe outstanding debt as at June 28 at 15.00, said Eskom. Zimbabwe started implementing load shedding on May due to a combination of low water levels at Kariba Dam's hydroelectric power plant, generation constraints at ageing power stations and limited foreign imports. On Tuesday morning Chasi took the highly unusual step of posting proof of payment to the SA power utility on his Twitter account.
