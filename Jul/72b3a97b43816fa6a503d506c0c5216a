The 18-year-old, the youngest player in the men's singles, said Ashe, who won Wimbledon in 1975 to add to his US Open (1968) and Australian Open (1970), was to be admired not only for what he achieved on court but also off it. Ashe died of pneumonia-related AIDS in 1993. Auger-Aliassime edged a step closer to striking off one of Ashe's Grand Slam wins by beating Frenchman Corentin Moutet 6-3, 4-6, 6-4, 6-2 to reach the last 32 at Wimbledon. "The comparison, yeah, it goes back far," said Auger-Aliassime. "Obviously, he's a big model for me but also many players. "But he was just a great human and he kind of changed things in a sport and in his life, and he changed a lot of people's lives. So I think that's what I take from him. And if I could do that one day in my way, that would be great, yeah. Hopefully I can have a similar career." Auger-Aliassime, who first picked up a racquet aged four and was coached by his Togolese father Sam till he was 12, said he had felt nervous prior to his match with Moutet due to him being the favourite. However, he added he is well acquainted with such feelings as he was sent away on his own to compete aged 10. Indeed this was a strategy of his father who explained it was common practice in Africa to give children autonomy so they could learn to look after themselves. "I can recall being ten years old and playing the first time away from home and being very nervous, you know," said Aliassime-Auger.
