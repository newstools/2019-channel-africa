Salah sat out of practice on Thursday with a cold and it is unclear whether he will be passed fit to face South Africa on Saturday in Cairo. According to Egyptian news provider, Kingfut, the forward is a doubt for the encounter which will come as good news for coach Stuart Baxter and his team. The 27-year-old is a world-class performer having hit 71 goals in 104 appearances for Liverpool over two seasons. In addition, the Nagrig-born player has two goals in three matches at AFCON and is most certainly a threat if he was to feature against South Africa. Bafana left-back Sifiso Hlanti will be hopeful that Salah does miss out as he is set to mark the right-sided forward in the game. This weekend's clash between the two sides is set to take place in the Egyptian capital at the Cairo International Stadium. Kick-off is at 21:00.
