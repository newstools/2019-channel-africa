Esther Arunga, 38, was convicted of being an accessory to murder. Australian associated Press quoted prosecutor Danny Boyle as saying that Arunga called emergency services and told them that the boy had fallen down the stairs. But an autopsy revealed Sinclair died “as a result of a severe blunt force such as punching or stamping or similar” and his injuries were inconsistent with a fall. She later admitted that she lied in order to protect her husband, Quincy Timberlake. According to Kenya's Standard newspaper, it was not until Timberlake was involuntarily admitted to a mental health facility that Arunga changed her statement. She told police that she went to the bathroom on the night of 17 June 2014 to find her husband hitting Sinclair in the stomach before throwing the boy against the wall. Judge Boyle said although Arunga did not interfere with evidence, her inaccurate account delayed investigations and her husband’s arrest. --BBC--
