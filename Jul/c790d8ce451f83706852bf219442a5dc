The Sidama, who are based in southern Ethiopia, have been threatening to declare their own breakaway region. Other ethnic groups say they will lose crucial resources if the Sidama succeed in forming their own state. Ethiopia, which currently has nine semi-autonomous regions, has become increasingly unstable since Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed came to power last year. There are fears that if the Sidama are granted their own region, other ethnic groups will also try to break away. --BBC--
