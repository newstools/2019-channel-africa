The UN said around 1,300 people were reportedly displaced last week and that attacks resulted in dozens of civilian deaths, hundreds of houses set ablaze and widespread looting of civilian goods. Farhan Haq, deputy spokesman for UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres, said that in these two regions, "the situation continues to be characterised by human rights and protection abuses and violations". He said despite increased humanitarian needs, Cameroon remains one the most critically under-funded humanitarian responses globally. The conflict in Cameroon's Anglophone regions has displaced more than half a million people since it broke out in 2016. Separatists are fighting for a breakaway state, they call Ambazonia, in the English-speaking regions of Cameroon. During a visit there in May, the UN human rights chief Michele Bachellet warned that the situation looks like it is spiralling out of control. --BBC--
