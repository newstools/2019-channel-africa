It was a superb display by the underdog Black Caps, who came into the match on the back of three straight defeats by Pakistan, Australia and England and only qualified for the semi-finals on net run-rate, while India topped the 10-team group stage. New Zealand will face the winners of Thursday's second semi-final between Australia -- the team that beat them in the 2015 final -- and hosts England in Sunday's title match at Lord's. "We had to ask a lot of questions. We knew if we created pressure we'd have a chance because it wasn't an easy pitch to score on," New Zealand's man-of-the-match Matt Henry said. "We pride ourselves on always giving ourselves a chance. They have world-class finishers and we knew we'd have to bowl them out to win. It's special to be going to Lord's on Sunday." Two-time world champions India lost key batsmen Rohit Sharma, Virat Kohli and KL Rahul for just one run each. They slumped to five for three in pursuit of a target of 240 and were 24 for four when Dinesh Karthik was out. New Zealand pacemen Henry (three for 37) and Trent Boult (two for 42) did the damage with the new ball. Shell-shocked India captain Kohli admitted his team had paid the price for the dismal start to their innings. "It's tough, 45 minutes of bad cricket put you out of the tournament. It's hard to come to terms with but New Zealand deserve it. They put us under pressure and came through in the key moments," Kohli said.
