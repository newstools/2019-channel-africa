Eskom, which supplies more than 90% of the country’s electricity but has implemented severe power cuts this year, fails to generate sufficient profit to meet its debt servicing costs and has required state cash injections to stay afloat. The cash injection, sourced from the government’s National Revenue Fund, provides R26 billion ($1.87 million) for the 2019/20 financial year and R33 billion ($2.37 million) for 2020/21.
