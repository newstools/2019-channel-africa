Christian Sewing, CEO for just over a year, and his finance chief are on week-long road show to explain the restructuring.  

To underline his commitment, Sewing plans to invest a quarter of his fixed salary  in Deutsche shares, a person with knowledge of the matter said.  

Deutsche’s stock price has fallen 10%  since Sunday’s restructuring announcement to cut 18,000 jobs in a $8.3 billion “reinvention”. It is the biggest two-day decline in almost three years. By 1312 GMT, shares were down 3.8% on the day, after sliding as much as 6.5% earlier. The bank’s bonds also fell.  

Analysts and investors say Sewing, who joined Deutsche Bank in 1989, is right to cut back its trading desks but question if he can make his plan work when interest rates are still low and United States banks have expanded their share of the German market.
