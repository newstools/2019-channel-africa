Swiss newspaper, Tribune Geneve, reports that the five men appeared in court on Wednesday and a sixth member of the team, a woman, had been released as she held a diplomatic passport. A statement by the regional government said a criminal complaint had been filed by a journalist, working for Radio Télévision Suisse (RTS), who alleged that he had been assaulted in front of a hotel while covering a demonstration by opponents of the Cameroonian president last week. The statement said the journalist was slightly injured and his equipment damaged. The RTS said the men were sentenced for "duress, damage to property and illegitimate appropriation". It added that the men received suspended sentences of at least three months. They were immediately released. Biya has been in power for more than 36 years and won another seven-year term in 2018. --BBC--
