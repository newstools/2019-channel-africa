The Liverpool ace has been busy representing Senegal at the 2019 Africa Cup of Nations (AFCON) and will be given extra time off after they made it all the way to the final. Senegal were beaten 1-0 by Algeria in the final before they all returned to their homeland to acknowledge their efforts, before then jetting off on holiday to recover. Klopp says he will be back with the rest of the squad just after the Wembley showdown with Manchester City, and days before the Premier League opener against Norwich City at Anfield. "He is in good shape," Klopp told the club's official website. "Obviously they had a celebration in Senegal and Iâ€™m happy about that because it showed that they respect the competition and saw second place as a success, which is nice. He is now on holiday, not the longest one, he will be back on August 5, after the Manchester City game. "That means he had two weeks. There are four or five days to prepare for Norwich, 10 days for Chelsea (in the UEFA Super Cup)."
