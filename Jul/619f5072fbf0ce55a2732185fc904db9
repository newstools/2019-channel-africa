The team left Zanzibar on Sunday, after spending the past few days unsuccessfully negotiating flight clearance with Kenyan authorities to land in Nairobi. “The authorities in Kenya say they were not happy with our routing and thus denied us entry,” said team leader Des Werner, father of 17-year-old Megan Werner, founder of U-Dream Global. "We do have the option to change routings but we just don’t have the time for it. Our feeling is that if they are difficult then we just don’t go there. It is after all their own country that misses out in terms of our team interacting with and inspiring youth in their country." The team is due to depart for Uganda tomorrow but they are still awaiting their permit to fly into Addis Ababa, which is currently following their scheduled stop. "We are slightly behind schedule but will catch up. If all goes well we hope to be in Cairo around July 7,” Werner added. The team is flying two four-seater Sling 4 aircraft, one flown by teenage pilots who have swapped since departing Cape Town on June 15, and another flown by an experienced support crew. Werner, who is flying in the support aircraft, says the team is in good spirits and that flying conditions have generally been good. --BBC--
