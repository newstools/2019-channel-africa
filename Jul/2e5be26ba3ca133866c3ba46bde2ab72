Government has also called for the perpetrators to be brought to book. Moyo was on a four-day re-engagement programme to strengthen bilateral relations and to lure investors. He also attended the Global Conference for Media Freedom. Acting Secretary for Foreign Affairs and International Trade Ambassador Pavelyn Musaka yesterday said Government was concerned with the incident. A source said inexplicable laxity by security services allowed the assailants to pounce, despite top-notch security having been provided prior to the incident. After the attack, tight security was restored. And now Zimbabwe is seeking answers. Government says as organisers of the event, it was incumbent upon the government of the UK to assess the threat level for all dignitaries and to provide under cover security details to protect Honourable Minister Moyo in the event of any unforeseen security situations arising. --Herald--
