Smith already has two victories under his belt at this iconic location, winning back-to-back events in 2010 and 2011, beating Adam Melling and Mick Fanning, respectively, in those two events. Smith has long been recognised as one of the best surfers at Supertubes, and apart from the two victories, has a number of 10-point rides as well as an extremely rare perfect 20-point heat score that he achieved in 2017. Many winter seasons were spent surfing the perfect racetracks of Supers, with Smith spending time at Cheron Kraak's house on the point, learning the subtleties of the break and discovering tricks and points of difference that only local knowledge can impart. Smith has such a unique approach to the waves at Supertubes as a result of all the formative years spent surfing there, and knows instinctively which waves are going to be the best options for high-scoring moves and barrels, as well as which ones to avoid. This gives him a massive advantage on people who have not spent as many hour at the break as he has. His current nemesis is Brazilian natural-footer Filipe Toledo. Winning the last two years in a row at JBay leaves Toledo with the chance of achieving a hat-trick this year at the JBay Open. He is fresh off a win at the Oi Rio Pro, the contest previous to the JBay Open, where he beat none other than Jordy Smith in the final. Sitting just above Smith in the rankings at number three, their sparring is most definitely developing into a rivalry of sorts. Toledo is also hungry for a world title, and with current ratings leader John John Florence out with an injury, there is a massive opportunity for these surfers to regain some ground in his absence. In 2019 has also seen a fresh take on the Smith persona, with Jordy opting for a plant-based diet, working on fitness, slimming down a little and looking focused but relaxed, as dangerous a combination as it gets. --News24--
