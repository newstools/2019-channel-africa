Several people have been injured in Thursday's clashes. The members of the pro-Iran Shia Muslim sect, the Islamic Movement of Nigeria, were demonstrating against the detention of their leader, Sheikh Ibraheem Zakzaky. He has been detained since 2015. Deadly clashes on Tuesday saw two people shot dead, according to protesters. Police denied this, saying they had used "minimum force" and that eight security personnel were injured.
