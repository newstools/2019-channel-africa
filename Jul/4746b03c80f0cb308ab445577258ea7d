Trump wrote on Twitter Thursday that he is “not a fan of Bitcoin and other Crypto-currencies, which are not money, and whose value is highly volatile and based on thin air,” adding that “unregulated Crypto Assets can facilitate unlawful behavior, including drug trade and other illegal activity.” He also criticised Facebook’s plans for the Libra digital currency. Bitcoin “continues to trade lower as comments from Trump put downward pressure on the crypto-currency,” said Alfonso Esparza, Senior Market Analyst at Oanda in Toronto. Drawing Trump’s ire does mean “it could fall further to $8 000, giving back all the gains made in June.”
