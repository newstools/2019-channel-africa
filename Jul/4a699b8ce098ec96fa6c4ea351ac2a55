BP’s underlying replacement cost profit, the company’s definition of net income, exceeded a forecast of $2.46 billion, according to a company-provided survey of analysts. Second-quarter production rose to 3.8 million barrels of oil equivalent per day, 4% higher than a year earlier. BP said it expects third-quarter 2019 reported production to be lower than second-quarter, reflecting maintenance activities as well as the impact of Hurricane Barry on operations in the US Gulf of Mexico.
