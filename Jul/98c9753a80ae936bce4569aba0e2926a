In an exclusive interview with Sport24, Robinson said South Africa's 36-34 win in Wellington last year has changed perception. "When we last spoke ahead of the clash in Wellington in 2018, I remember I was quite convinced that the All Blacks would easily beat the Springboks at the Westpac Stadium. 

"I'm going to change tack this time and say that South Africa are definitely the front-runners. I think almost everyone in New Zealand is expecting the All Blacks to go in as underdogs. The Springboks have been touted as favourites and rightly so," Robinson said. Robinson said he was not impressed with the All Blacks' performance in their narrow 20-16 win over Argentina in Buenos Aires last weekend. "The All Blacks looked very average against Argentina in round one of the abbreviated Rugby Championship. They were laborious in terms of some of their plays and their backline attack was very fractured a lot of the time." But Robinson also warned: "As we know with every All Black side, after a sub-par performance one week they tend to fix it and right the wrongs the following week. The Springboks shouldn’t expect their hosts to lie down and for it to be an easy run. "The one thing I am excited about is the Richie Mo'unga and Beauden Barrett 10-15 axis. I think it could be the start of a bit of a master plan from Steve Hansen in terms of his thought process. "Mo'unga's goal-kicking was in the high 80% range in Super Rugby. He is a more consistent goal-kicker than Barrett and has shown maturity in Super Rugby and with the All Blacks over the last three seasons. 

"He has been blooded into the All Black environment really well and has earned the respect of his peers and grown the confidence, so that he can drive and direct the team from flyhalf." Saturday's Test in Wellington is scheduled for 09:35 (SA time).
