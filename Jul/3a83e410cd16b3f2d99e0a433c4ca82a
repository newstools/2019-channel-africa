Twenty-four of 30 economists in the survey taken over the past three days said the repo rate would be cut by 25 basis points to 6.50% on July 18. Two expected a cut of 50 basis points. The other four said rates would be left unchanged. “Conditions in South Africa have been shifting in favor of a rate cut for some time,” said Razia Khan, chief economist for Africa and Middle East at Standard Chartered Bank. Economists assigned a median 60% probability rates would be cut on July 18, even though inflation is expected to average 4.5% this year, the centre of the Bank’s 3% to 6% target range. The median forecast for economic growth was 0.7% for 2019. That is 0.1% point higher than last month’s median, when economists lowered their forecasts because of a quarterly 3.2% contraction when the year began. South Africa’s private sector has been shedding jobs recently, including in the interest-rate-sensitive banking industry, where banks have already cut or announced plans to cut staffing. Khan who predicted a 50-basis-point cut next week said the daily drip-feed of retrenchment headlines should, in theory, make little difference to the SARB because it is the economic outlook that matters to it. “The reality, however, is that it does impact psychology and people expect – especially with inflation well-behaved – that the SARB should be in a position to react to their perception that the economy is weak,” Khan said. --Reuters--
