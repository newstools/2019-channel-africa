Senong‚ who has been coach of Amajita for five years since 2014, did not have his contract renewed after its expiry at the end of June. The former Orlando Pirates and Mamelodi Sundowns youth development coach has had success with the junior national team, winning back-to-back COSAFA U-20 championships in 2017 and 2018. Senong also led Amajita to two bronze medal berths at the 2017 and 2019 Africa U-20 Cup Of Nations tournaments to qualify for an unprecedented two World Cups in succession‚ however saw his charges booted out of both competitions without registering any victories. According to acting SAFA chief executive Russel Paul, as reported by TimesLIVE, the next Amajita coach will be employed on either a caretaker basis or full time. “You will know probably on Wednesday or Thursday‚” Paul told TimesLIVE. It’s not yet known at this stage where Senong will next be headed to, even though he will not be short of potential suitors given his credentials. Last year he obtained a Master’s Coaching Diploma at the Johan Cruyff Institute in Amsterdam, Netherlands, to add to his already impressive CV. -- dailyworthing--
