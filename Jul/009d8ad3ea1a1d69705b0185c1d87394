Moeti recently visited one of the high-risk districts in western Uganda. Since last month, when Uganda declared the Ebola virus disease outbreak, there have been three confirmed cases, all of whom had travelled to the neighbouring Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC). Uganda shares a nearly 900-kilometre long, often porous border with the DRC, where the disease has claimed more than 1 400 lives since last year August. More than 100 people who had contacts with the confirmed cases are being monitored. Since the outbreak was declared, 1 063 high-risk individuals have been vaccinated. --AfricaNews--
