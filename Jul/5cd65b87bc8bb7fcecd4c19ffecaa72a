Kolisi has been on the sidelines for the last couple months following a knee injury. However, Coach Rassie Erasmus revealed that he is progressing nicely and is aiming to run on for Western Province in the Currie Cup before the end of the month. Following that, Erasmus is hoping the forward can get two Test matches under his belt before the Rugby World Cup starts in Japan. "Siya will stay with us until after Saturday's Test and then go home and the good news is he could be back sooner than expected," Erasmus said. "He could run out for Western Province in two weeks' time, and then we'd be confident to get him back for the last two Tests before we fly out to Japan." The Springboks host Australia in the opening match of the 2019 Rugby Championship at Ellis Park on Saturday. Kick-off on Saturday is atÂ 17:05 CAT --Sport24--
