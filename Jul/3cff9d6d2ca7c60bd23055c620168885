In a meeting in London with Foreign Affairs and International Trade Minister Dr Sibusiso Moyo yesterday, British Minister of State for Africa at the Foreign and Commonwealth Office Harriet Baldwin gave the reforms the thumbs-up, while UN communications specialist Sirak Gebrehiwot made similar remarks in Masvingo while speaking to journalists on the side-lines of a media workshop on Monday. In a statement last night, Secretary for Information, Publicity and Broadcasting Services Nick Mangwana said the meeting between Moyo and Baldwin was encouraging as it would enhance bilateral cooperation between the two countries. Britain expects to cooperate better and more, following very encouraging reforms by Zimbabweâ€™s new Government in legislative, economic and the media. Moyo left the country on a four-day re-engagement programme to strengthen bilateral relations and lure investors. He is also expected to attend the Global Conference for Media Freedom which started yesterday. The conference is being co-hosted by the British and Canadian governments. --Herald--
