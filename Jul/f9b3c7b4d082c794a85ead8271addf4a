The beverage company also raised some of its full-year profit benchmarks, boosting shares. Net income was $2.6 billion, up 12.6% from the year-ago period. Revenues climbed 6.1%to $10 billion. Soft drink sales rose 4% during the quarter, with the company's namesake beverage selling well. The company's revamped diet soda, Coca-Cola Zero Sugar, also again notched higher volumes. The company pointed to new packaging sizes in North America, as well as product launches, such as "Coca-Cola Orange Vanilla." Coca-Cola has also introduced myriad non-carbonated water, juice and coffee-based drinks in a pitch to consumers concerned about health and high sugar levels. Volumes increased in Europe, Middle East & Africa and in Latin America, but operating income declined in both regions due largely to the hit from a strong dollar. "Our strategy to transform as a total beverage company has allowed us to continue to win," said James Quincey, chief executive of Coca-Cola. "Our progress is positioning the company to create more value for all of our stakeholders, including our shareowners." Shares rose 1.6% to $52.07 in pre-market trading. --AFP--
