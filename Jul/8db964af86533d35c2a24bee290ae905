Job Sikhala, the deputy chairperson of the Movement for Democratic Change, was arrested last week and charged with attempting to subvert the government, a crime that carries a 20-year jail term upon conviction. Sikhala, through his lawyers, has denied the charge. Sikhala was given bail by a High Court judge in Masvingo, a town 300km south of the capital, according to his lawyer, Alec Muchadehama. He will be released later on Monday after paying $570 and surrendering his passport, Muchadehama said. The charges against Sikhala stem from a video circulating on social media, in which the politicians appears to be seen and heard telling supporters at a weekend rally, “We are going to take the fight to the doorsteps of Emmerson Mnangagwa. We are going to overthrow him before 2023. That is not a joke.” Reuters has not been able to verify the authenticity of the video. More than a dozen government opponents have this year faced similar charges, with critics saying this shows that under Mnangagwa, the government is reverting to harsh Robert Mugabe-era security laws to muzzle the opposition. --Reuters--
