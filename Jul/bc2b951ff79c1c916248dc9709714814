Four leading Zimbabwean filmmakers were granted bail on Monday after being charged for allegedly screening a film without approval.

The film makers were arrested after screening their film The Lord of Kush at the weekend.

Prosecutors argued that the film, which depicts an unnamed religious group abducting the child of a Zimbabwean ambassador to Pakistan, could invoke conflicts among religious groups. Simon Muchemwa reports from Harareâ€¦ --ChannelAfrica--
