Once the project takes off, it will significantly address the on-going electricity shortages causes by low water levels in Kariba Dam and obsolete equipment at Hwange Thermal Power Station. Crucially, the high cost of solar equipment, mainly because it is imported, has prevented citizens from harnessing solar energy. Yaowei Technology director Cheng Hangjian told journalists in Harare yesterday that they are in the country to seek investment opportunities especially in renewable energy to ease power shortages. We want to set up a solar power factory worth US$15 million in Zimbabwe. At least a one hectare piece of land is enough to set up the first phase of the project,” said Mr Cheng. “The plant is expected to produce at least 500 solar panels a day to augment power supply in the county and will also help in creating job opportunities for the locals. “Currently, we are doing feasibility studies to seek more investment opportunities.” Cheng said Zimbabwe has enough resources to turn around the fortunes of the economy, but there is need to invest in research to tap the available investment opportunities. --Herald--
