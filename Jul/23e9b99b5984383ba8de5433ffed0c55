The rugby fraternity was shocked when news broke that Small had died of a heart attack at the age of 50. Small played 47 Tests for South Africa between 1992-1997, scoring 20 tries in the process. Small made his debut against the All Blacks on August 15, 1992 at Ellis Park in Johannesburg in a match the reigning world champions won 27-24. Small was most famously part of the Springbok team that won the 1995 Rugby World Cup on home soil, this time beating the All Blacks 15-12 in extra-time. Small is the third member of that Springbok team to have died - loose forward Ruben Kruger died from brain cancer in 2010 and scrumhalf Joost van der Westhuizen from motor neurone disease in 2017. In addition, coach Kitch Christie also passed away in 1998. For much of the 1990s Small and Lomu were the dominant wings in world rugby. Lomu terrorised defences at the 1995 World Cup, scoring an unforgettable four tries in the semi-final against England at Newlands. However, in his 63 Tests, none of his 37 tries were scored against the Springboks - something Small had a major hand in ensuring. Equally tragically, Lomu died in late 2015 at the age of 40. On Thursday, Lomu's wife Nadene too to Twitter to pay an emotional tribute to Small.
