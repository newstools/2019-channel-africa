The African team was suspended by the ICC due to government interference in their cricket board affairs and more players could follow Mire into calling it quits at the highest level. The 29-year-old Mire played two Tests, 47 ODIs and nine T20Is for Zimbabwe and scored a century and five fifties across all three formats but has now made the decision to go in a different direction with his life. "It is unfortunate and untimely however to leave under the current circumstances that are out of my control but i have decided to take a step in a new direction," Mire said in a statement on his Instagram account. "Representing my country at the highest level for me has been the highest honour and service i could ever give and I have been extremely privileged to have been afforded the opportunity," Mire wrote. "My short career has been a roller coaster of highs and lows, stops and starts, frustrations and joys but will be one I shall look upon and cherish for the once in a lifetime opportunity I was lucky enough to experience and for that I would like to express my gratitude." His only hundred came in an ODI away to Sri Lanka when he struck 112 to help Zimbabwe to a historic series victory. The right-handed batsman thanked each and everyone that played a role in his development as a player since he made his international debut in 2014. "Also a special thanks to the fans. I can hardly believe that I had fans from across the world, I'm sure most were friends and to the ones I'll never meet, thank you all so much," wrote Mire. "I can say without a doubt that sport and in particular international cricket will always be my biggest lesson in life. Ever." --News24--
