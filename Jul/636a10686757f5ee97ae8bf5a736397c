Revised official figures shows that GDP expanded by 2.5% during 2018. The figures also revealed that growth slowed during the second quarter as exports declined and companies invested less in their businesses. GDP grew at an annual rate of 2.1% between April and June, ahead of expectations but below 3.1% recorded in the first three months of the year. Growth in the second quarter was better than the 1.8% expansion forecast, and was supported by stronger consumer spending and a jump in government spending. However, the pace fell short of the first quarter as both foreign trade and business investment shrank as the US continued its trade war with China. Nancy Curtin, chief investment officer of Close Brothers Asset Management, said: "Growth has come off the boil in the US, but investors should not be too downbeat; it has beaten expectations. "While slower growth reflects the global impact of the ongoing trade tensions and export slowdown, the labour market and productivity improvements have provided a bright spot in recent weeks." --BBC--
