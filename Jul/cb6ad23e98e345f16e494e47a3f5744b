The Al Qaeda-linked Islamist group al Shabaab, which is trying to topple Somalia’s weak United Nations-backed government, claimed responsibility for the attack. The city’s Madina hospital received 17 bodies and 28 people with injuries, 12 of them in a critical condition, said Mohammed Yusuf, the hospital’s director. The blast went off at the first checkpoint on the road that leads to Mogadishu airport, said Farah Hussein, a shopkeeper who witnessed the attack. Somalia has been riven by civil war since 1991, when clan warlords overthrew a dictator, then turned on each other.
