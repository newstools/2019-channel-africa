Constant Cap told BBC Newsday that it "almost sounds like they are using the continent as a dumping ground for what they don’t need anymore". Kenya already has a big market for used Japanese cars, he added. China has an estimated fleet of more than 300 million privately-registered vehicles, the largest in the world. One of its potential markets is Africa where second hand cars are very much in demand because they’re much cheaper than new vehicles. But Cap has strong reservations about what it could mean for the Kenyan capital, especially in terms of air pollution. "At the moment, the last thing we need is second hand vehicles that are almost like wastes from other countries", he said.
