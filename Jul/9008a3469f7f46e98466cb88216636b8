According to reports, the move will see Tau loaned out for the upcoming 2019/2020 campaign without an option to buy. The 25-year-old was last season named as the Proximus League Player of the Year in Belgium's second tier after starring for Royale Union Saint-Gilloise. In his maiden season in Europe, the on-loan Brighton attacker made 34 appearances, scoring 11 goals and providing 13 assists. Work permit rules in the United Kingdom meant it was virtually impossible for Tau to play for the Seagulls, and it is believed that he still fails to qualify for a visa for the upcoming season.
