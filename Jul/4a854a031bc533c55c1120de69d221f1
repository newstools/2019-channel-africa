The DRC leader said the violence appeared to be a "plot" and vowed to "find out the truth" about who was behind the deadly unrest. Fighting in Ituri province between militias connected to Lendu farmers and Hema herders has killed at least 160 civilians since June ten, Tshisekedi said on Tuesday at the end of a three-day visit there. "Clearly, this looks like an attempt at genocide. To push Ituri to ignite," he said at a press conference in the city of Bunia. Tshisekedi added the aim was apparently to "destabilise the power" of the central government in the capital, Kinshasa. The gold-rich region has experienced ethnic conflict before with more than 60 000 people killed and 500 000 others displaced as a result of clashes between the two groups between 1999 and 2003, according to the United Nations. In an attempt to end the latest outbreak of violence, Tshisekedi on Sunday ordered DRC's army to launch a "large-scale" operation against armed groups in Ituri's Djugu and Mahagi territories. He said the offensive would also see operations extend further south, including to South Kivu province, in a bid to put a "definite end" to the dozens of rebel groups active in eastern DRC. Tshisekedi added his government also devised a plan for the "complete eradication" of foreign armed groups operating in the region. The operation was put together in collaboration with the United Nations peacekeeping mission and neighbouring countries affected by the violence, including Uganda and Rwanda.Â
