The July 3 air strike on Tajoura detention center killed 53 people and injured 130, according to the latest death toll from the World Health Organisation. The UN has said the strike on the camp, holding an estimated 350 people this week, could amount to a war crime. The strike occurred as eastern forces under Khalifa Haftar keep up a ground and aerial offensive to wrest control of Tripoli from the UN-backed government. The two sides blame each other for the attack. It left frightened migrants and refugees desperate to leave the centre in an eastern suburb of the capital. The UN has also called for the migrants to evacuate to safety. "At some point yesterday (Tuesday), a decision was taken by authorities to release the detainees. They were also given an option, they were not compelled," UNHCR Spokesperson, Charlie Yaxley, said. In all, some 260 migrants immediately left and walked to a UNHCR departure facility where they were allowed to stay overnight and given emergency assistance. They are expected to go to a community day center where they will receive food, water and medical care, he said.
