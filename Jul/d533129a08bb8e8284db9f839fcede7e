Meanwhile, 32-year-old Jamaican sprinter, Shelly Anne Frazer-Pryce rolled back the years as she claimed gold in the women’s 100m. After a good a day at the office for Team South Africa in day one of the London Diamond League, a lot was expected in day two of the event. South Africa’s 27-year-old Dominique Scott took to the track in the Women’s 5000m event. Things didn’t go her way as Kenyan athletes were having a field day. Obiri set a new meeting record, winning the race in 14 minutes 20.36 seconds. Tirop recorded her personal best time of 14 minutes 20.68 seconds. Dutch athlete, Sifan Hassan finished third, setting a new European record. South Africa’s Wanda Nel took part in the Women’s 400m hurdles final. However, she found the going tough as Jamaican, Rushell Clayton, had a good start. The 26-year-old created a big upset to win the race. In June, she clocked 54.73 in her native Jamaica, beating even Janieve Russell, the 2018 Commonwealth Games champion, who eventually finished out of the medals in fourth. For the first time this outdoor season, Samuel Tefera’s aggressive tactics did not cost him the win. The Ethiopian sprinted past Norwagian, Filip Ingebrigtsen, in the final straight to record a world-leading time of 3 minutes 49.45 seconds. The indoor 1500m world record holder had allowed the Norwagian to pass him at the bell, but Tefera managed to wrap around him with less than 120m to go. The Norwegian finished the race in 3 minutes 49.60 seconds. Briton Jake Wightman was third after running his personal best of 3 minutes 52.02 seconds. Antonio Alkana lined up for the Men’s 110m Hurdles. The South African could only settle for the fifth place in the race won by China’s Wenjun Xie.
