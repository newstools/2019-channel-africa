The minister was speaking in Parliament on Wednesday, after delivery of his Budget Vote Speech. He says they need to have a forum that includes all roleplayers in the sport that can find the root cause to the current state. Minister Mthethwa, who was in Egypt for South Africa’s games at the Afcon, says that the way Bafana Bafana played against the host country, should be how the team always performs. While the minister says their focus is not only football, it is the most popular sport in the country, and should be a priority.

Mthethwa also wants to see women’s sport get more scope and hopes that the corporate will come to the table and support the establishment of a national women’s league.
