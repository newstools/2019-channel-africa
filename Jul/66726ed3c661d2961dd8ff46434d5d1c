Lukaku has been strongly linked with a move to Serie A this summer and is yet to feature for United in pre-season, and although Inter Milan seemed like the leading candidates, it is now Juventus who appear to be pressing strongest. Reports have suggested that Juventus are happy to send Paulo Dybala to Old Trafford as part of a swap deal, however, the Argentine international looks set to decline that move as he wishes to stay in Turin. Now the Daily Mail (via Sportsmole) states that United are interested in signing Douglas Costa from the Italian champions instead of Dybala. The Brazil international had a season plagued by injury in 2018/19 and may find playing time even harder to come by next season depending on new boss Maurizio Sarri's plans. Despite this, the former Chelsea manager has publicly backed the player by saying: "We need to start with talented players and Douglas Costa is one of them." The 28-year-old, though, is a target for United as they look at adding a new right-winger, with Marcus Rashford set to start up front under Ole Gunnar Solskjaer next term. It was claimed earlier in the month that Juve believed they could convince United to lower their ($188 million) asking price for French midfielder Paul Pogba by offering to send Joao Cancelo, Costa and Blaise Matuidi to Old Trafford.
