Brent crude futures rose 38 cents, 0.5%, to $64.61 a barrel by 10:45 am EDT (1445 GMT). United States West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures rose 47 cents, or 0.8%, to $57.98 a barrel. Iran on Monday threatened to restart deactivated centrifuges and step up its enrichment of uranium to 20% in a move that further threatens the 2015 nuclear agreement that Washington abandoned in 2018. Washington has imposed sanctions that eliminate benefits Iran was meant to receive in return for agreeing to curbs on its nuclear program under the 2015 deal with world powers. 

The confrontation has brought the United States and Iran close to conflict, with U.S. President Donald Trump calling off air strikes in June minutes before impact. 

On Sunday, Trump issued another warning over Iran’s nuclear activities. “They’d better be careful,” he said. Iran’s Oil Minister Bijan Zanganeh said on Sunday that he was very hopeful of an improvement in the country’s crude exports, state TV reported. “We see enough possibility of military conflict to cushion renewed price declines that might be driven by mounting expectations for a major slowing in the global economic growth path,” Jim Ritterbusch of Ritterbusch and Associates said in a note.
