The news serves as a double blow to Ramaphosa's government, which won May elections vowing to halve unemployment, after Africa's most developed economy has suffered through mass layoffs, rolling blackouts and contracting gross domestic product (GDP). South African opposition parties lashed out at Ramaphosa and his ruling ANC party over the 29 % joblessness rate, saying the country had an "unemployment catastrophe" and warning that the situation was getting worse. The country's statistics agency StatsSA said in its quarterly report that "the unemployment rate increased by 1.4 % points from 27.6 % in the first quarter of 2019 to 29 % in the second quarter". "This is the highest level recorded since 2008," when the quarterly labour force survey was introduced, StatsSA said. The figure rises to 38.5 % under the expanded definition of unemployment which includes those who have given up looking for work. The unemployment figures came as South Africa's power company Eskom, which generates around 95 % of the country's electricity, reported a record net loss of $1.46 billion for the year to March, nearly 10 times more than in the previous 12 months. Eskom imposed a period of rotational power rationing in February, plunging offices, factories and homes into darkness for long hours and negatively impacting business and lulling job creation prospects. The company has accumulated $30 billion of debt despite multiple bailouts from the government. South Africa's banks, mining and construction sectors have in recent months signalled mass layoffs as GDP contracted by 3.2 % in the first three months of 2019, the largest quarterly drop in about 10 years.  --AFP--
