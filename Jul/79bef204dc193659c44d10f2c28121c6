A quarterly loss was deeper than expected, and despite record deliveries in the quarter, revenue came in lighter than analysts’ expectations. Moreover, margins, a focus of investors, narrowed in the quarter, adding to Tesla’s challenges in delivering profit going forward. Shares fell 11.5% after hours and extended losses after the announcement about Straubel, a founding engineer who will become a senior adviser. Under pressure to meet his repeated promises to make Tesla sustainably profitable, Chief Executive Elon Musk is trying to contain costs while still spending on major initiatives from a Shanghai factory and assembly-line to upcoming models such as the Model Y SUV and a Semi commercial truck. Tesla initially promised to be profitable in the third quarter of 2018 and has now pushed back that target multiple times. Now profit is expected in the fourth quarter of 2019, with the current quarter to be break-even, Musk said. --Reuters--
