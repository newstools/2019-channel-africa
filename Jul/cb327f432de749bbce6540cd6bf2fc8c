Soutrh Africa's Minister of International Relations and Co-operation, Naledi Pandor, will look at the continent’s readiness to implement the African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA). The agreement will see African countries trading amongst themselves. It is hoped that this will translate into 2,5 trillion US dollar market. The meeting comes at the time when many countries around the world are scrambling to do business with African countries. The trade war between United States and China has prompted the countries to look to Africa for Investment. The meeting will look at the budget for AU, the theme for the AU in 2020, as well as the adoption of AU’s legal instruments and the new structure for the Commission. South African President, Cyril Ramaphosa, will join other African Heads of State in Niger on Monday where a plan of action on implementation will be adopted. South Africa, as the incoming Chair of the AU, will have to ensure the implementation of the Free Trade Area; and the good news is that Nigeria has finally taken a decision to sign the African Continental Free Trade Area.
