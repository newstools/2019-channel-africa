However, the Sports and Recreation Commission, whose suspension of the ZC board triggered the saga, say they have no obligations to act since the International Cricket Council (ICC)’s directive was to the suspended leaders of the domestic game. The SRC also revealed that, in consultation with the ZC interim committee, they were, in the meantime, attending to the welfare issues of contracted players and employees of Zimbabwe Cricket. ICC chief executive, Manu Sawhney, wrote to suspended ZC board chairperson, Tavengwa Mukuhlani, yesterday, advising him that should their reinstatement not be done before October 8, Zimbabwe Cricket’s membership could be terminated. It’s a new position by the ICC since the last communication from them only dealt with suspension of Zimbabwe Cricket, the freezing of financial support and the prohibition of local cricketers taking part in events under the auspices of the world cricket controlling body. Sahwney’s latest communication also said the ICC did not allow “pubic or quasi-public’’ entities from involvement in the affairs of their member associations. The ZC board was suspended on June 21 for ignoring a directive from the SRC to shelve their elective annual meeting in Victoria Falls amid allegations of electoral irregularities and financial misappropriation. However, the Sports Commission said, as far as they were concerned, it was business as usual in their intervention mechanisms since the ICC letter was directed to Mukuhlani for action and not them. “The Sports and Recreation Commission’s (SRC) attention has been drawn to correspondence dated the 24 July, 2019 from the International Cricket Council (ICC), addressed to Tavengwa Mukuhlani, a member of the suspended Board of Directors of Zimbabwe Cricket,’’ the SRC said in a press statement. The correspondence sets out the terms and conditions upon which the ICC may review the decision to suspend the Zimbabwe Cricket’s membership. --Herald--
