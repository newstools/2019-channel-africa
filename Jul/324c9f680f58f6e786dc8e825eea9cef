The benchmark Nikkei 225 index rose 0.30%, or 64.29 points, to 21.702.45, while the broader Topix index was up 0.65%, or 10.24 points, at 1.589.78. "The New York Dow's renewing its record was certainly positive news for Tokyo," said Toshikazu Horiuchi, a broker at IwaiCosmo Securities. All three major stock indices on Wall Street ended at records after a plethora of mediocre US economic data appeared to boost the odds of a Federal Reserve interest rate cut. "But the rate cut expectations raised concerns over a rise in the yen against the dollar, which limited today's gains," Horiuchi told AFP. Trading was stagnant "as many players were on the side-lines, focusing on the release of US unemployment figures" scheduled for Friday, he said. --AFP--
