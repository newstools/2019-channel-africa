The 30-year-old played for the Cheetahs between 2011 and 2014, before playing for the Bulls in 2015 and 2016. He then joined the Kubota Spears in Japan and also played Super Rugby for the Sunwolves. Labuschagne has qualified for the Japanese national team having fulfilled World Rugby's three-year eligibility criteria. Another South African, lock/flank Wimpie van der Walt, will be on the bench for the Pacific Nations Cup match on Saturday. He has already earned nine Test caps for Japan since making his debut in 2017. "It's a massive honour and privilege to play in the Brave Blossoms jersey representing a great country like Japan," Labuschagne told the Japan Times. Kick-off is at 07:50 (SA time) on Saturday.
