Muhammad Adamu told a conference of police officers that the group was a threat to national security and unity. He said all forms of protest or procession by the IMN are banned. The sect condemned the ban saying they are a peaceful organisation. Human rights groups have also criticised the move but the Nigerian authorities say their decision does not violate religious freedom. The leader of the IMN, Sheikh Ibrahim el-Zakzaky, was arrested in 2015 during a military crackdown in which more than 300 of his followers were killed. The military had accused his followers of trying to assassinate Nigeria's army chief when they allegedly blocked a major road on which a military convoy was travelling leading to clashes between the two sides in Kaduna state. He is now facing charges relating to attempted murder, inciting violence and public disturbance. IMN members frequently march on the streets to demand for his release citing deteriorating health conditions. A High Court in the capital, Abuja, ruled in 2016 that Sheikh Zakzaky should be released, but the courts in Kaduna have ignored the order. More than 20 people including a senior police officer and a journalist were reportedly killed following clashes between the Shia members and the police in Abuja last week. Sheikh Zakzaky's bail application hearing is expected on August 5.
