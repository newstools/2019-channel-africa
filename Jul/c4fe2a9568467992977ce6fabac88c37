In neighbouring north-eastern India the death toll from floods rose to six, with 870,000 people affected, officials said. Heavy rains since Thursday have hit several districts in Nepal, especially in the country's eastern region and the southern plains. A Home Ministry official said that so far 11 people have died, 13 are injured and another eight have been reported missing. Three were killed when a wall collapsed in the capital Kathmandu. "Local authorities and our security officials are all working to rescue people and bring them to safety. Helicopters are on standby if needed," Umakanta Adhikari told AFP. Nepal's weather department warned Thursday that heavy rains were expected to continue for two days, and advised people to stay alert. Nearly 150 people died last year in Nepal during the rainy season, which typically begins in late June and lasts until the end of August. In the north-eastern Indian state of Assam monsoon floods have now inundated 21 districts, officials said Friday. In Bangladesh aid groups were providing rations to Rohingya refugees in the southeast of the country with the UN World Food Programme saying Friday that two people including a child had died. --AFP--
