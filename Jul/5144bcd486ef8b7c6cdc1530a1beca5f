The model of development for the projects will include conversion of existing infrastructure to hospitality facilities as well as development of new infrastructure. This comes as Zimbabwe has low hotel stock, lower than what is available in Sandton, Johannesburg, alone. Currently, Harare has 1 628 room capacity while Victoria Falls has 1 128 rooms with Bulawayo at 370 rooms. Troughton said the global hospitality giants, among them the Protea Hotels, One and Only Resorts, Hilton Hotels and Resorts, TAj, Four Seasons and Bon Hotels have expressed interest in the country for new projects or conversion of already existing buildings into hotels. The success of the projects is however hinged on stability of the macro-economic environment. “Sentiment has been very positive, a lot of interest was generated especially last year. Arrivals also increased last year.  While there have been currency changes, I don’t think the sentiment has changed yet, we are just waiting to see how it goes before investors press the final button,” he told The Herald Business yesterday on the sidelines of the ZimReal Property Investment Forum in Harare. “This is just going to change the time-line as investors observe the situation with the currency issues because it is going to have an impact on development for instance the importation of materials. “Zimbabwe has always had significant investor interest, basically it has all it takes for a quick turnaround but there has been a lot of speculation on political issues,” he said. Zimbabwe Tourism Authority (ZTA) chief operating officer Givemore Chidzidzi said Zimbabwe was lagging behind in terms of tourism infrastructure giving scope for real estate investors to tap into the market given the vast existing opportunities. --Herald--
