Between 2010 and 2018 the number of people dying in the region from the disease plunged by 44% to 310 000. The study, by UNAids, highlights South Africa as having lowered Aids-related deaths in that period by 40%, while new HIV infections have dropped by more than 40%. In western and central Africa the numbers dying declined by 29%, to 160 000. Globally, the number of deaths from HIV has fallen by a third since 2010. UNAids attributes the declining death rate to increased access to antiretroviral drugs. Some 23.3 million people out of the 37.9 million people living with HIV now use the drugs. But the agency warns the gains made risk being slowed down by inadequate funding, saying some countries made promising improvements while others have reported new HIV infections and HIV-related deaths. Nevertheless, UNAids chief Gunilla Carlsson said that ending Aids altogether is possible "if we focus on people not diseases". --BBC--
