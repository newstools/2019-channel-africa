A huge fireball was seen in the early hours of Thursday causing panic in the state's Ijegun area. Footage shared on social media shows huge flames and residents fleeing just before dawn. The country's emergency management agency Nema says it has alerted the national oil company about the fire and has "also called on the safety unit of the corporation to immediately shut down further supplies through pipeline in order to suffocate the fire". The agency's Ibrahim Farinloye said that some of the suspected vandals may have been affected by the fire. There has been no confirmation of any casualties. --BBC--
