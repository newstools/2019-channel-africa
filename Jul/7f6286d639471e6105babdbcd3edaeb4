Only three counters accounted for the DSE’s second quarter liquidity: Tanzania Breweries, which contributed 79 per cent of the total turnover, CRDB Bank (9 %) and Vodacom (7 %). “All other counters together contributed just 5 %, some of them showed zero deals most of the time,” said DSE chief executive officer Moremi Marwa. The bourse also experienced a one per cent fall in cumulative market size during the second quarter, mainly due to share price drops in six counters. The cumulative market size for the 21 domestic listed companies, as measured by market capitalisation, declined by $29 million compared with the first quarter ended March 31. Total domestic market capitalisation decreased to $3.941 billion during the second quarter, one per cent lower than the $3.969 billion from the first quarter.  --TheEastAfrican--
