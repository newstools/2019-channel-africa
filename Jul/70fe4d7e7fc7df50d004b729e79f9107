Countries producing food for the European market must provide proof of its traceability, said Vincent Ssempijja, the minister for agriculture, animal industry and fisheries, on Tuesday. He said products from Uganda were being impounded and banned from the EU. â€œFarmers will be registered and their products given barcodes so that if they find a problem with one box, they look for the source and sort out the problem," he said. "We cannot enter lucrative markets unless farmers register," he added. --BBC--
