After 72 holes, Ireland's Shane Lowry was a deserved winner, romping to a six-stroke victory over England's Tommy Fleetwood. Erik van Rooyen and Louis Oosthuizen were the leading South Africans, finishing in a tie for 20th place on 1-under par, a full 14 strokes behind Lowry. The pair banked $91 350 each for their four days' work. Dylan Frittelli and Ernie Els finished in a tie for 32nd on 1-over par and took home $56 278 (R785 000). Justin Harding was a further shot adrift on 2-over par which was good enough for a tie for 41st and $36 925. The sixth and final South African to make the cut was Branden Grace who finished on 3-over par in a tie for 51st. Grace, now ranked 67th in the latest world rankings, banked $28 317. --News24--
