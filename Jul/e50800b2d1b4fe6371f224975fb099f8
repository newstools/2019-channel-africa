This is one of the issues that will be up for discussion at a Tanzania-Uganda business forum to be launched in Dar es Salaam by Presidents Yoweri Museveni and John Pombe Magufuli on September 4. Uganda, which is trying to increase its exports to the East African Community is looking to create a mutually beneficial relationship with Tanzania. Currently, Uganda exports over $60 million worth of goods to Tanzania, making its southerly neighbour one of the smaller export destinations for Ugandan goods. But Ugandaâ€™s High Commissioner to Tanzania Richard Kaboneero, hopes that this state of affairs will change once the two countries realise that working together is mutually beneficial for trade and investment. Kaboneero said that he is looking to foster this mutually beneficial relationship through the business forum that will be preceded by a joint permanent commission between Uganda and Tanzania. The 25 per cent tariff that Tanzania continues to charge on sugar and edible oil from Uganda is among issues up for discussion at the September meeting. For much of last year, sugar and edible oil extracted from sunflower had been stopped from entering the Tanzanian market, over allegations that these products were imported into Uganda, repackaged and then re-exported to markets in the EAC. A visit by Tanzanian officials to Ugandan factories producing sugar and edible oils found that Kampala was not importing and then re-exporting these products to its East African neighbours. A bilateral meeting between Ministers of Trade Amelia Kyambadde of Uganda and Joseph Kakunda of Tanzania was then held during which they agreed to remove tariff and non-tariff barriers on edible oil and sugar. The ministers then signed a deal to issue import permits for sugar and edible oil. --TheEastAfrican--
