The 72-year-old Japanese diplomat had held the position of IAEA Director General since 2009, taking over from Mohamed El-Baradei and steering the UN agency through a period of intense diplomacy over Iran’s nuclear program while seeking in vain to return to North Korea. His death coincides with a sharp escalation of tensions between Iran and the West following Washington’s decision last year to quit a 2015 international deal that curbed Tehran’s nuclear program in return for an easing of economic sanctions. President Donald Trump has reimposed United States sanctions on Iran, and the fate of the landmark deal, which the IAEA has been overseeing, is unclear. "The Secretariat of the International Atomic Energy Agency regrets to inform with deepest sadness of the passing away of Director General Yukiya Amano," the IAEA said in a statement. Amano had been preparing to leave his position in March, well before the end of his third four-year term, which ran until November 30, 2021. Diplomats who follow the agency had said he planned to announce his decision on Monday. The IAEA announced in September 2018 that Amano had undergone an unspecified medical procedure. The specific nature of his illness has remained a taboo subject within the agency, diplomats said, but with each public appearance he had appeared increasingly frail.
