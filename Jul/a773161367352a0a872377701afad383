In a BBC Newsday interview, Dr Emanuele Capobianco of the Red Cross, said this suggests there are more chains of transmission, which would make it harder to stop the virus spreading. Goma, a bustling city of about two million people, is on the border with Rwanda. There have been more than 2 500 cases of Ebola in DRC since the outbreak began a year ago. Capobianco said the immediate response to this latest case had been good and the Ebola vaccine would be given to people who may have come into contact with the patient, a man in his 40s.
