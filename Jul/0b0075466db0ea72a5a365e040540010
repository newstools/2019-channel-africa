Second-quarter earnings started off on a dour note last week as results from major banks raised concerns about profit growth in a low interest rate environment. Tech earnings on the other hand have been robust, with Microsoft Corp and International Business Machines reporting profit beats. "We are going into another round of earnings which is going to set the tone for markets, and US-China trade talkâ€™s look like they can go forward and that is a positive thing," said Kim Forrest, chief investment officer at Bokeh Capital Partners in Pittsburgh. The South China Morning Post reported US trade negotiators will likely visit China next week for their first face-to-face talk with Chinese officials since the G20 meeting, when Trump held off on fresh tariffs on Chinese goods. As earnings season progresses, profits at S&P 500 companies are now estimated to rise about 1%, according to Refinitiv IBES data, in a reversal from earlier expectations of a small drop. --Reuters--
