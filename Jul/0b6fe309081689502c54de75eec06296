The journalists were arrested after publishing stories that called for the sacking of Ghana's Minister for National Security. One of the stories was an opinion piece suggesting that Albert Kan-Dapaah, the National Security Minister, was plotting to take over the leadership of Ghana's governing New Patriotic Party ahead of elections next year. A second article focused on a group lobbying President Akufo-Addo to fire the minister. The two journalists from the online news site ModernGhana.com were arrested last Thursday and accused of engaging in cybercrime. They deny the charge and say they were tortured in custody. One of the journalists, Emmanuel Ajarfor Abugri, said he and his colleague had their heads were covered with polythene bags, and that they were repeatedly beaten and tasered by security men. They have now been released. Ghana's National Security Secretariat has denied the claims of torture, which have been widely reported in the country. The main opposition party, the NDC, has called for the National Security Minister to resign. Ghana is generally a media-friendly country, but recent developments, including the unresolved murder of an undercover reporter Ahmed Hussein Suale, have prompted criticism from rights groups at home and abroad. --BBC--
