History, particularly at Ellis Park, has a lot to do with that. The sides have met a total of 10 times at the iconic venue, with the Springboks winning 9 of those. Their only loss came all the way back in 1963, when the Wallabies scored the only try of the game to secure a 10-9 victory. South Africa's overall record at Ellis Park, meanwhile, also makes for good reading and they have won 35 of their 50 matches at the venue since 1928 with a win percentage of 70%. The Boks have won 35 of their 46 Tests against Australia in South Africa for a win percentage of 77.17% on home soil, while they are also slightly ahead in the overall head-to-head stats. There have been 87 Tests between the sides at all venues since 1933, with the Boks having won 47 of those (55.74%) while the Wallabies have won 37 and there have been 3 draws. History obviously doesn't guarantee anything, but it does show that the Springboks have had the upper hand over their southern hemisphere rivals, particularly on home soil. Kick-off on Saturday is at 17:05.
