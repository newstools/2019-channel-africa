"Mboweni reminded investors that South Africa faces major fiscal challenges, mainly due to the substantial burden of Eskom which needs to be properly restructured," said Piotr Matys, a currency strategist at Rabobank in London. Mboweni announced earlier on Tuesday that the cash-strapped power utility would receive an additional $5 billion during the tabling of a special appropriation bill for Eskom. The bill specifically states that the money must be allocated to Eskom to "assist with its financial obligations" While the additional government aid will enable the utility to meet its financial obligations this financial year, it remains the biggest threat to the nationâ€™s finances and its operating model needs to be overhauled, Mboweni said.
