Following a United States decision to withdraw from northern Syria, the two NATO allies agreed to create a sanctuary in the region that would be cleared of the Kurdish YPG militia, which Ankara sees as a terrorist organisation. Turkey has been infuriated by US support for the YPG, the main US ally on the ground during the United States’ fight against Islamic State militants, and has demanded that Washington sever ties. After US special envoy for Syria James Jeffrey held talks with Turkish officials, Turkey said on Wednesday it had run "out of patience" with Washington and warned that it would carry out a military operation in the region if an agreement on the safe zone was not reached. 

Turkish Foreign Minister, Mevlut Cavusoglu, said the United States was stalling progress on the safe zone, just as it did with a joint roadmap agreed to clear the northern Syrian town of Manbij of the YPG in 2018. --Reuters--
