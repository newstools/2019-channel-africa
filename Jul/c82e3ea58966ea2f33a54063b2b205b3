Van Biljon was responding to members of the Communications Committee in Parliament’s questions on the SABC’s on-going financial crisis. She says, "The infamous Day Zero, if it is equated to the day we can’t pay salaries … the three months focus at this point in time, pending the continued support of our trade creditors does not indicate that we will be unable to pay salaries, but we’re unable to invest in content." Van Biljon, SABC Board Chairperson Bongumusa Makhathini, Chief Executive Officer Madoda Mxakwe and the Acting Chief Operating Officer, Craig van Rooyen, appeared before the committee on Wednesday to present the Public Broadcaster’s corporate strategic plan. The SABC is struggling to pay an almost $14 million debt. Its expenditure exceeds revenue. To add to this, the broadcaster is expected to register a $46 million loss in the current financial year. The corporation is still battling to secure a $23 million government guarantee which it needs to get out of the crisis. "We are unable to invest in marketing; we are unable to do the critical maintenance and repair our buildings. The success of a funding intervention is a key component of this corporate plan that is in front of the honourable members today," Van Biljon explains. She adds that "Without the $23 million, we cannot execute any of the numbers that you have seen here. We really just limp along literally. That is what we do."
