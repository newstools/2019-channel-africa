In a report released on Wednesday, the rights watchdog said the Special Criminal Court needs to recruit more judges, prosecutors and staff and get more government and international support. The court consists of 25 judges, 13 from the CAR and 12 foreigners, and has a total budget of $67.9 million to probe crimes during more than a decade of ethnic and religious conflict. It is backed by the United Nations and the European Union. The court currently only has 20 domestic judicial police officers, directed by prosecutors and judges, to investigate crimes from a succession of conflicts. "Central Africans have waited so long to see justice for the many killings, rapes, and other atrocities committed in the Central African Republic," said Elise Keppler, associate international justice director at Human Rights Watch. "The Special Criminal Court holds promise but it's had a slow start and needs to intensify investigations so trials can be initiated base on strong, compelling evidence." --AFP--
