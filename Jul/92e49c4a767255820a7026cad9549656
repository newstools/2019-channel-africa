The country's electoral board has now promised to hold a delayed referendum on the issue in the next five months. Sidama's top administrator, Qarre Chawicha, has urged people to be patient. Thursday marks a year since the idea of a referendum was approved by the administration of the Southern Nations, Nationalities and Peoples' Region (SNNPR), which currently governs Sidama. Legally, the referendum should have been held within this time but the electoral board failed to organise it saying that it was undergoing reforms that have now been completed. A demonstration in SNNPR's main city, Hawassa, does not appear to be planned for Thursday but some activists may symbolically raise a flag, the BBC's Kalkidan Ybeltal reports. SNNPR, one of Ethiopia's nine states, is made up of dozens of ethnic groups and there has been concern that if the Sidama are granted their own federal state, other ethnic groups will also try to break away.
