Mosimane is proving to be one of the most successful coaches in the history of Sundowns after winning the CAF Champions League in 2016. His side's performances in Africa have attracted attention from some major clubs all over the world, including from the cash-rich Arab world. Nonetheless, 'Jingles' insists he wants to honour his contract with the Brazilians, telling reporters: "Ever since I am at Sundowns I have honoured my contracts, I stay and finish my contract. I don't hold the team to ransom to say 'see now the people of Qatar how much they want to give to me and then give me (same amount) otherwise I am going to Qatar. "I have never done that and I would never do that. I am a decent man and if it was that I could have used that against Sundowns and if they don't give me I would have gone. I don't do that, I am humbled and I am aware in Africa I am appreciated. For me to go work for TV in Egypt, the only channel that won the AFCON rights and they say do Egypt games. They can't give to me, I mean there are so many people that could have been given but they gave it to me to say we want you to be here and talk about Egypt.Â 

"I am humbled. My (co) analyst showed me that the Wydad fans are asking their president and want me to come over as a coach. You get humbled, you get honoured. "There is a Qatar deal on the table. I have to honour my contract, you have to do the right thing, the money will always follow success, so do well, do the right things, it will always come right. I don't want Sundowns to say 'ah but this guy had a contract' you know the story and you can't go. "I understand, I am living properly with my means I'm okay, I am not living above (my means). I don't have any ambition of being a billionaire because I am not going to be a billionaire, not in South African football and African football."
