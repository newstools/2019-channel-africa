The lake, like many of East Africa's so-called Great Lakes, has been hard hit by overfishing, leading to increasing clashes between those plying its waters and authorities. John Mongella, the governor of Mwanza region in northern Tanzania, told ITV Television a fight broke out between local fishermen and a police unit battling illegal fishing on Monday. "Shots were fired, killing three villagers. The villagers then shot the person heading the patrol unit," said Mongella. Tanzanian authorities have stepped up patrols on the lake. Jumanne Muliro, police commander for the Mwanza region, said the police unit had seized nets used for illegal fishing on the island of Siza. "The village chief called the owners of the nets who, upon arrival, attacked our unit," he said, adding police then opened fire. Lake Victoria, which stretches into Kenya, Tanzania and Uganda and whose catchment also touches Burundi and Rwanda, is known for its unique biodiversity. In 2018 the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) warned that plant and animal life in Lake Victoria was being "decimated", with 20% of species facing extinction. --AFP--
