Bafana endured a hot and cold campaign in which they lost two group matches but still managed to reach the last 16 by beating Namibia. However, they produced their best performance of the competition in defeating hosts Egypt in the first knockout stage with Thembinkosi Lorch getting the late winner. With that said, it appears the game against the Pharaohs took its toll on coach Stuart Baxter's men as they bowed out in the next round with a 2-1 loss the the Super Eagles. It remains to be seen whether South African supporters will greet the team as heroes at O.R Tambo this weekend, though it seems likely there will be a warm welcoming committee. The majority of the players in the squad are set for a pre-season break as they have been in national team camp since early June. Mamelodi Sundowns have already confirmed that Hlompho Kekana, Sibusiso Vilakazi, Tiyani Mabunda, Lebohang Maboe and Themba Zwane will be given two-weeks leave. South Africa will land at 13:00.Â
