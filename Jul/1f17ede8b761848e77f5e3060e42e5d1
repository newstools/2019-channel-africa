In a joint statement following a meeting in Pretoria on Thursday, they emphasised that the effective coordination of fiscal and monetary policy was a central pillar of good macro-economic management and policy certainty. They say this coordination reduces any potential or unnecessary uncertainty around the formulation and implementation of the macro-economic framework. Last month, a statement by African National Congress (ANC) Secretary-General, Ace Magashule, about the ruling party’s resolutions to expand the central bank’s mandate beyond price stability to include growth and employment caused a public spat within the party with both Mboweni and the ANC’s head of economic transformation Enoch Godongwana denying that such a decision was taken.
