Rebel fighters captured the villages of al-Jabin and TelMelah in northern Hama province in early June during a counterattack against government forces that have been waging a Russian-backed offensive in the area since late April. A rebel commander in the area confirmed opposition fighters had withdrawn from al-Jabin after heavy bombardment. The pro-Damascus al-Watan newspaper said the Syrian army had advanced in the area as Syrian and Russian warplanes targeted militant positions and after several days of preparatory fire. More than 400 civilians have been confirmed killed in the escalation of violence in northwestern Syria over the last three months and more than 440 000 displaced, the United Nations (UN) Office for the Co-ordination of Humanitarian Affairs said last week. Ongoing shelling and air strikes included the use of â€œindiscriminate weapons, such as barrel bombs", it said. The use of these weapons, which are dropped from helicopters, by the Syrian army has been widely recorded in the eight-year conflict. The targeted area is part of the last major foothold of the rebellion against President Bashar al-Assad, who has vowed to take back "every inch" of Syria. However, his side has failed to make significant gains during the latest campaign. The Idlib area of the northwest is dominated by Tahriral-Sham, the jihadists formerly known as the Nusra Front. It is proscribed as a terrorist group by the UN Security Council. Groups backed by Turkey also have a presence in the area. The Syrian government has described its operations as a response to militant violations of ceasefire agreements. --Reuters--
