The news comes after a video of the aid workers emerged. In the video the only female among them made a passionate appeal to the authorities and the international community to facilitate their release. The hostages, who work with aid agency Action Against Hunger, were abducted last week in Borno state when suspected Boko Haram militants ambushed their convoy and killed one of their drivers. Government Spokesperson, Garba Shehu, told the BBC that the authorities are hopeful the aid workers would be freed. Shehu has not given details of the negotiations but he called on the captors to show mercy. Earlier, Action Against Hunger said the six, comprised of one staff member, plus drivers and health workers employed locally, are "apparently in a good condition of health". The kidnapping has once again highlighted the risks humanitarian workers face as they try to deliver aid to millions of people affected by the Boko Haram conflict in the Lake Chad region. Last year, two female staff members from the International Committee of the Red Cross were abducted and executed by militants in north-east Nigeria.
