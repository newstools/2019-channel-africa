In a post on Twitter, Els said he was very disappointed to not tee it up at the Renaissance Club and will have a rest ahead of next week's Open Championship. "Was really looking forward to teeing it up @ScottishOpen this week at The Renaissance Club, but injured my back while practising and have to rest. Very disappointed," he wrote. Els hope to be fit for the 148th Open Championship at Royal Portrush from July 18-21. The 'Big Easy' will be hoping to make his 29th Open Championship appearance having won the tournament in 2002 and 2012. Meanwhile, there are 15 South Africans competing in the Scottish Open, including defending champion Brandon Stone, who won his third European Tour title at the Gullane course near Edinburgh 12 months ago. --News24--
