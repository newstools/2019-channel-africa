The elections were due to have been held this year, but have now been scheduled to take place together with the general election next year. This is the second postponement. Last year, the elections were postponed to this year because of political unrest. Ethiopia has been hit by a wave of ethnic and political conflict since Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed took office last year on a promise to introduce far-reaching political and economic reforms. There are fears that the instability could jeopardise the holding of a free and fair general election and damage Abiy's credibility.
