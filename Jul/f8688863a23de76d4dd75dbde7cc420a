This is mid-point within the target range of between 3% and 6% set by the SA Reserve Bank, and in line with the expectations of economists. Ahead of Wednesday's announcement, analysts from NKC Economics projected inflation to come in at 4.4%. The main contributors to the 4.5% annual inflation rate were food and non-alcoholic beverages, housing and utilities, and transport. The Rand was unchanged following the announcement, trading at R13.91/$.
