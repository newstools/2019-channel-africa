The company reported its largest-ever quarterly loss of $3.4 billion on Wednesday due to the troubled plane. If hurdles with regulators worldwide continue, Boeing said it would consider reducing or shutting down production of the 737 Max entirely. However, Boeing boss Dennis Muilenburg is confident the plane will be back in the air by October. Boeing's entire fleet of flagship 737 Max planes were grounded in March after an Ethiopian Airlines flight crashed, killing 157 people. Five months earlier, 189 people were killed when a Boeing 737 Max operated by Lion Air crashed. --BBC--
