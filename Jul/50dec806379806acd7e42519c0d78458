Duminy announced in March that he would be stepping down from one-day cricket after the tournament, but revealed after the victory over Australia in the Proteas' final World Cup fixture that he would be retiring from all forms. "I've been considering it for the last couple of months and I've made the decision that this (game) will be my last," he told the gathered South African media after the win at Old Trafford on Saturday. "I went into the game with the guys knowing that it would be my last." Duminy finished on 199 one-day caps, 46 Tests and 81 T20 caps. The Cape Town-born left-handed batsman failed to finish his career off on a high, registering scores of 8, 45, 3 and 14 in the World Cup. The 35-year-old admitted that his numbers, batting averages of 32.8, 36.8 and 38.6 in Tests, ODIs and T20Is respectively, were not going to put him in to any hall of fames, but said he would rather be remembered for being a 'team player'. "It's not about the numbers you want to be remembered for," he said. "It's about the the person you are. "On a personal note it has been enjoyable representing South Africa. There have been many lows. There have been some dark times where I thought it may have been the end of my career. 

But particularly in sport, you find a way to get through it. And that is through the help and support for the fans backing you. So I am thankful for that, not only for myself but for the team."
