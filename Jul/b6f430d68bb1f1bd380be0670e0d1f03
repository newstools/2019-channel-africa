After big losses at the start of the week, trading floors have been much more upbeat since a two-day congressional testimony in which Powell hinted at a possible reduction in borrowing costs, with markets now betting on the size of the anticipated cut. After the Dow stocks index pushed above 27 000 points for the first time on Thursday positive sentiment filtered through to Asia and Europe on Friday. US stocks continued to rally on Friday at the opening bell, with the Dow adding 0.3%. "Dealers remain divided as to the size of the (Fed) cut but the view across the board is that monetary policy will be loosened," said analyst David Madden at CMC Markets UK. Further stock market gains came despite unease caused by US President Donald Trump accusing China of backsliding on a trade promise just days after the two sides tentatively began telephone talks on resolving their tariffs war. Meanwhile, China's economy grew at its slowest rate in nearly three decades in the second quarter, hit by the US-China trade war and weakening global demand, according to an AFP survey of analysts. The world's second largest economy expanded 6.2% in April-June, the poll of ten economists estimated, ahead of the official release of gross domestic product figures Monday. --AFP--
