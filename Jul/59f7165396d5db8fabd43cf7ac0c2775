The minister is asking the court to suspend Busisiwe Mkhwebane's binding remedial orders and interdict her office from enforcing them until a judicial review of her report is concluded. In a report released on July 5, Mkhwebane found that Gordhan had violated the Constitution and the Executives Ethics Code, in a report that related, among other things, to the establishment of the 'rogue unit' in 2007. Gordhan was at the time the South African Revenue Service (SARS) commissioner. Mkhwebane found that the establishment of the unit was unlawful and instructed President Cyril Ramaphosa to take appropriate disciplinary action against Gordhan. In his submission, Gordhan’s lawyer, Advocate Wim Trengove, stated that Mkhwebane’s findings relied on an earlier report by Advocate Muzi Sikhakhane, which has been rejected. He said that the Public Protector failed to afford Gordhan a chance to be heard before deciding on the remedial action. Sikhakhane’s conclusion was "obviously wrong", he argued, adding that it had been repudiated by the Nugent Commission as well as Judge Frank Kroon, who chaired the SARS Advisory board. Trengove further argued that it would be unlawful for Ramaphosa to discipline Gordhan without affording him a hearing. --News24--
