Banyana Banyana are fresh from the FIFA World Cup in France where they were knocked out in the group stages few weeks ago. They will be defending the title they won in 2018, and are paired in Group A alongside Malawi, Comoros and Madagascar after the draw was made at Cosafa headquarters in Johannesburg on Wednesday.

Ellis is expected to give young players a chance to play in the Cosafa Cup that will be hosted in Port Elizabeth in August.Â Some of the senior players who took part at the world cup are also expected to take part according to Ellis. Banyana did not have a good debut world cup after they suffered a 3-1 defeat to Spain, 1-0 loss to China and a humiliating 4-0 defeat against Germany. There were reports that Ellis did not get along with some of the senior players such as Leandra Smeda and Jermaine Seoposenwe, but she denied it. Banyana also won the tournament in 2017 in Zimbabwe. Captain Janine Van Wyk is looking to use the tournament to regain their confidence. The team has not won a single match in 2019.
