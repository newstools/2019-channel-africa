The national team recently touched down back in South Africa following a hot and cold 2019 Africa Cup of Nations campaign. Stuart Baxter's charges registered a single win in their Group, however, still qualified for the last 16 via the best of third-placed teams. It was against the home nation where Bafana Bafana surprised the world as they handed the Pharaohs a shocking 1-0 defeat in front of 75 000-strong crowds. However, South Africa was then sent packing after a 2-1 quarter-final defeat against African powerhouse Nigeria. Algeria is the biggest movers, climbing 28 places to number 40 following their victory over Senegal in the final of the Africa Cup of Nations. In spite of winning their first continental title in 29 years, the Algerians are only the fourth-ranked team in Africa behind Senegal (20), Tunisia (29) and Nigeria (33), another team they beat in the semi-finals. Meanwhile, Copa America winners Brazil have leapfrogged World Champions France, climbing to second place in the latest FIFA rankings, released on Thursday. Brazil beat Peru 3-1 at the Maracana stadium earlier this month to collect their ninth continental title. Belgium still tops the rankings while France slips to number three. --News24--
