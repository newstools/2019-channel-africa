Flyadeal will operate an entirely Airbus SE fleet, the company said Sunday in a statement, buying as many as 50 A320neo-family planes from Boeing’s European rival.

The Airbus order was booked in June at the Paris Air Show by the discounter’s parent, Saudi Arabian Airlines. That announcement had sparked speculation about whether the planes would be allocated to Flyadeal, which had said in December it would spend up to $5.9 billion on Boeing Max jets. "We understand that Flyadeal will not finalise its commitment to the 737 Max at this time given the airline’s schedule requirements," Boeing said Sunday in an email. "We wish the Flyadeal team well and hope we can support their fleet and operational needs in the future." Boeing shares were down almost 1% in pre-market trading on Monday against Friday’s close of $355.86. 

Flyadeal will take delivery starting in 2021 of 30 Airbus A320neo aircraft, with an option for a further 20 planes from the same family of single-aisle jets. The decision marks a commercial setback for Boeing, which is under pressure to prove the Max is safe and get it flying again after two disasters five months apart killed a combined 346 people. 

The narrow-body workhorse has been grounded globally since March.
