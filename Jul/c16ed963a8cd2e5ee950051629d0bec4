The landslide, caused by heavy rain, buried the van on Wednesday evening in the area of Asni. The bodies of 11 women, three men and a child were extracted overnight from the van, authorities said in a statement. The van was carrying passengers from Casablanca to the village of Taliouine, 670 km south of Rabat, witnesses said. The landslide created a pile of earth and mud 20 meters high that blocked the mountainous road.
