The head of the Ugandan Revenue Authority, Doris Akol, said the shortfall was due to people using wireless networks and virtual private networks to avoid the daily tax of around $0.05. The government said the levy was needed to raise more funds. It led to street protests and was criticised for being part of a wider attempt by the authorities to stifle free speech and prevent social media from being used to organise peaceful protests. --BBC--
