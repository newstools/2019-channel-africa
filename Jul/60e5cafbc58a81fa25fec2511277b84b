Woakes struck twice early on as Australia slumped to 14-3 after winning the toss in Birmingham but Steve Smith led the recovery for Australia with 85 and Alex Carey made 46. The hope for Australia is that an attack led by left-arm fast bowler Mitchell Starc, the tournament's leading wicket-taker with 26 scalps, can defend a seemingly low total. All three of England's defeats at this tournament, against Pakistan, Sri Lanka and Australia, have come batting second. England, bidding to reach their first final since 1992 and yet to win the World Cup, made a sensational start. Australia's prolific opening pair of David Warner and Aaron Finch, as well as Peter Handscomb, were all back in the pavilion by the seventh over. Warner, who walked out to boos because of his role in a ball-tampering scandal in South Africa last year, returned to even louder jeers after being dismissed for nine. Smith, who was also given a 12-month ban for his part in the incident, was given a similar greeting when he made his way to the wicket. Smith and Carey steadied the innings with a fourth-wicket stand of 103 before leg-spinner Adil Rashid (3-54) struck twice in five balls. Australia wicketkeeper Carey had his helmet knocked off by a Jofra Archer bouncer and required several minutes of on-field treatment. With his head swathed in a bandage, Carey resumed his innings but in sight of a fifty he hoisted Rashid straight to substitute fielder James Vince at deep midwicket. Four balls later, Australia were 118-5 when all-rounder Marcus Stoinis was lbw for a duck to Rashid's googly. The dangerous Glenn Maxwell then holed out to England captain Eoin Morgan off Archer for 22 and Pat Cummins was caught by Joe Root to give Rashid another victim. --News24--
