The United States has put Huawei on an export blacklist citing national security issues, barring United States suppliers from selling to the world’s largest telecommunications equipment maker and number two maker of smartphones, without special approval. Huawei’s revenue growth of 30% in the first half is a slowdown from 39% in first three months of 2019, but is up sharply from 2018, Bloomberg said. Huawei has so far managed to boost revenue by aggressively securing contracts for fifth-generation networking equipment, Bloomberg said. The company is said to have rewarded a number of employees for helping it accelerate revenue despite US ban, Bloomberg added. Huawei declined to comment on the Bloomberg report. --Reuters--
