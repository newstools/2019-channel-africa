Having won the 2018 ATP Finals trophy, Zverev started this campaign as the man tipped to dethrone the likes of Roger Federer, Rafael Nadal and Novak Djokovic, but he has fallen well short. He has won only one title, the Geneva Open, while his best performance at the Grand Slams was a quarter-final appearance at the French Open. Besides his on-court struggles, he has also had off-court battles as he is involved in a legal dispute with his former manager Patricio Apey. The duo went their separate ways at the end of last season, but Apey insists their contract is valid until 2023. The world number five, though, is confident the matter will be solved soon. "Hopefully this issue wonâ€™t be an issue any more soon," Zverev said. "It will become clearer over the next days. Everything will be slowly cleared up so that I can completely concentrate on tennis again." Zverev crashed out in the first round at Wimbledon earlier this month and it led to German great Boris Becker raising questions about Ivan Lendl's contribution as his coach. --News24--
