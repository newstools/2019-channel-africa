Earlier on Tuesday, Fin24 reported that Zimbabwe Energy minister Fortune Chasi posted proof of the countryâ€™s $10 million payment to Eskom on Twitter. The country has been suffering power outages due to outstanding debt. Eskom is owed a total of $33 million from Zimbabwe. On Tuesday afternoon, it said in a statement that it had received a payment from Zimbabwean authorities, but did not name the amount. "Discussions will continue with the Zimbabwe Electricity Supply Authority (ZESA) to find a mutually beneficial solution to the outstanding debt. Eskom is a commercial operation and will be guided by the contracts we have in place with ZESA," Eskom's statement read. In his Twitter post, Chasi also said that further discussions with Eskom would be needed, as the repayment of debt did not guarantee power supply. "Whilst we have paid $10 million, this is no guarantee for power. We need to negotiate," he Tweeted. --News24--
