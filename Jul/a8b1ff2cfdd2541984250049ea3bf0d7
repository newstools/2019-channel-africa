Now, 20 days into the biennial tournament, the Indian Ocean islanders have stunned three-time champions Nigeria and are preparing to face Tunisia on Thursday in the last quarter-final. While France-born coach Nicolas Dupuis insists "the team is the star", midfielder Andrianantenaina and forward Andriamahitsinoro have caught the eye. Bulgaria-based Andrianantenaina was among the 11 footballers chosen by a Confederation of African Football (CAF) panel as the best in the 36-match group phase. Andriamahitsinoro, who plays for a Saudi Arabian club, made the substitutes list in the group 'dream team', and his two goals have put him in contention for the Golden Boot award. "The coach is correct to say the team is the star and, sometimes, an individual will stand out when we need him to. That is our strength," explained Andriamahitsinoro. He stands out on the field because he has blond dyed hair and is tall in a squad of mostly medium-height footballers. Tunisia coach Alain Giresse says his first target of a last-eight place has been achieved, adding: "We are capable of lifting the trophy 15 years after doing so for the first time." --AFP--
