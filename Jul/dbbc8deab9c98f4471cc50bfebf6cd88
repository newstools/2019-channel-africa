The Nairobi-based Africa Network for Animal Welfare (ANAW) says that donkeys face an "imminent" and looming "extinction". It argues that since four commercial donkey abattoirs opened in 2016 in Kenya a "humongous number of donkeys are being slaughtered on a daily basis". It estimates that 410 donkeys are being killed every weekday. ANAW says that the demand for donkey skin comes from China. The report adds to concerns that were already being expressed in 2017. At that time the BBC reported that people were complaining that their donkeys were being stolen to feed the growing market. But the head of one abattoir said: "We are happy with the Chinese, because before there was nothing coming from donkeys, but so many people are benefiting from the donkey now today." ANAW says "donkey-dependent communities stare at economical hopelessness" and want the abattoirs shut down. Its report says estimates for Kenya's donkey population range from 900 000 to 1.8 million. --BBC--
