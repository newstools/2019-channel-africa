“They were accused of being al Shabaab members. They were also among the attackers in the bombing of the Nasahablod Two Hotel, in which 18 people died and 47 others were injured,” Somalia’s state news agency said on its website. They were executed by gunshot. Al Shabaab, a militant group which is trying to topple Somalia’s central government, was ejected from Mogadishu in 2011 and has since been driven from most of its other strongholds. It remains a threat, with fighters frequently carrying out bombings in Somalia and neighbouring Kenya, whose troops form part of the African Union-mandated peacekeeping force that helps defend the Somali government. --TheEastAfrican--
