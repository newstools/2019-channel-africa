The Finance Minister made the announcement on Tuesday as he tabled the Special Appropriations Bill in the National Assembly. Mboweni announced that Eskom will get $5 billion over the next two financial years and the SABC will get $23 million. "Once this bill is passed this afternoon. We will be in a position to use Contingency Reserve Account to provide support to the SABC, to Denel, to South African Airways." "But this support the SABC requests of $23 million we will not make that just available tomorrow. It would be a mistake. We would release in chunks as certain conditions are met to make sure thereâ€™s progress in improving the organisation," Mboweni explains. The Finance Minister says he will announce the appointment of Chief Risk Officers for the entities on Wednesday. The financial support measures will come from the Contingency Fund. --SABC--
