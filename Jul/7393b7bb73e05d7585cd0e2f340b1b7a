This is despite a rise in vanilla, sugar and maize exports, according to the Performance of the Economy report, a monthly tracker produced by the Ministry of Finance. The report released last week shows that total gold exports dropped to 2.2 tonnes in April from 8.6 tonnes in March. Gold fetched Uganda $549 million in 2018 from $339 million the previous year. In March this year, Kampala exported gold worth $363 million the biggest monthly haul that saw the country register a trade surplus with the East African Community, the rest of Africa and Europe. In April, however, gold earnings dropped to $88.6 million. Coffee, Uganda’s top crop export, also declined to 306 315 60kg-bags in April, from 348 230 bags in March. The volume of beans exports also dropped to 4.2 tons, from 7.1 tons. Within the EAC bloc, Kenya remains Uganda’s main trading partner. Overall exports to the EAC declined 9.8 % in the year ending April 2019 to $86.79 million, from $96.22 million in April 2018. --TheEastAfrican--
