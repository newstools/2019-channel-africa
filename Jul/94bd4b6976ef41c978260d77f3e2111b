Boeing’s deliveries are lagging European rival Airbus SE, which handed over as many as 389 planes in the same period, up 28% compared to a year earlier, according to sources.

Meanwhile Saudi Arabian budget carrier Flyadeal reversed a commitment to buy as many as 50 Boeing 737 Max jets, becoming the first airline to officially drop the plane since its grounding following two deadly crashes. Flyadeal will operate an entirely Airbus SE fleet, the company said Sunday in a statement, buying as many as 50 A320neo-family planes from Boeing’s European rival. The Airbus order was booked in June at the Paris Air Show by the discounter’s parent, Saudi Arabian Airlines. That announcement had sparked speculation about whether the planes would be allocated to Flyadeal, which had said in December it would spend up to $5.9 billion on Boeing Max jets. "We understand that Flyadeal will not finalise its commitment to the 737 Max at this time given the airline’s schedule requirements," Boeing said Sunday in an email. "We wish the Flyadeal team well and hope we can support their fleet and operational needs in the future." Boeing shares were down almost 1% in pre-market trading on Monday against Friday’s close of $355.86.
