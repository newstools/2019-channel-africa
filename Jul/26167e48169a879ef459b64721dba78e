The WGC-FedEx St Jude Invitational tees off at TPC Southwind in Memphis, Tennessee, on Thursday and the total purse is a not-too-shabby $10.25 million (R143 million). The two South Africans in the field are Justin Harding and Louis Oosthuizen. England’s Tommy Fleetwood and America’s Tony Finau and Brooks Koepka, who all finished behind Lowry at Royal Portrush last weekend, are among the many “big guns” at the tournament. There’s also the lesser-valued Barracuda Championship taking place at Montreux G&CC in Reno, Nevada, where $3.5 million is up for grabs. The field for the unique modified stableford points scoring system includes South Africa's Tyrone van Aswegen. There's no tournament scheduled on the European Tour this week and this means several South African professionals will have their feet up. On the local tournament scene, the Sunshine Tour will resume next week with the Royal Swazi Spa Challenge. --News24--
