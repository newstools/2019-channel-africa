Nike’s potential retrenchment from the surfwear market is emblematic of the stance of most major consumer companies towards the sector. Surf brands have lost their appeal among non-surfing consumers, who now prefer boutique brands and retro street wear. Among the options that Nike is considering for Hurley is an outright sale of the Costa Mesa, California-born brand, the sources said, requesting anonymity because the deliberations are confidential. It is not clear how much Nike could fetch by selling Hurley. Nike declined to comment. Nike purchased Hurley from founder Bob Hurley in 2002 for an undisclosed sum in an effort to expand beyond athletic-focused apparel and into other sportswear for surfing, skating, and snowboarding. Bob Hurley founded the company in 1979 and achieved notoriety in the 1970s for shaping the surf board for world champion Wayne “Rabbit” Bartholomew. --Reuters--
