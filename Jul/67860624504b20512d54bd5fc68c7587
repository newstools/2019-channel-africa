Salman Abedi, a 22-year-old Briton born to Libyan parents, blew himself up at the end of a show by United States singer, Ariana Grande, in the deadliest militant attack in Britain for 12 years. The explosion killed 22 people and injured more than 500. London had sought the extradition of his brother Hashem after police issued an arrest warrant for murder, attempted murder and conspiracy to cause an explosion. But Tripoli had long stalled on the request, made in November 2017. “He has today been successfully extradited, for offences relating to the Manchester Arena attack,” Greater Manchester Police Chief Constable Ian Hopkins said in a statement. “He was handed over by Libyan authorities to British police officers this morning. They escorted him on the flight back and he landed in the United Kingdom a short while ago.” Police said Hashem Abedi, 22, would appear at Westminster Magistrates Court on Thursday. A spokesperson for the Tripoli-based Special Deterrence Force (Rada), who asked not to be named because of the sensitivity of the case, said he was extradited in accordance with a court verdict.
