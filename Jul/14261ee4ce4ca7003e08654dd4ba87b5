They also want the European Union to restart coordinated naval patrols in the Mediterranean to rescue migrants. In a joint statement, they also said support for the Libyan coastguard should be made conditional on it not returning any rescued migrants to Libyan ports. The statement follows an airstrike earlier this month on a facility outside Tripoli, in which more than 50 migrants were killed. UNHCR and the IOM say the 5 600 migrants held in such centres must be immediately "freed in an orderly manner and their protection guaranteed, or evacuated to other countries from where accelerated resettlement is needed". --BBC--
