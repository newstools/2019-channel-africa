Overfishing has devastated the seabed in Ghana’s sea territory. The United Nations estimates that 2 million people, or 10% of the total population of this small country in West Africa, depend on this crucial sector. Mercy Allotey, a fish business on the Accra waterfront is at risk. The number of fish caught off Ghana has decreased by almost half in fifteen years, from 420,000 tonnes in 1999 to 202,000 tonnes in 2014. Responsibilities are shared between factory boats, often operated by Chinese companies that scour the seabed, and devastating environmental practices of tens of thousands of small-scale fishers trying to offset losses. In a practice known locally as “ saiko “, which was once a way of recovering “leftovers” from large fishing vessels, trawlers have developed an extremely lucrative trade. They collect en masse fish usually targeted by local fishermen, including sardines and mackerel, and sell them to communities on the shores via intermediaries. In a report released in June, the Ghanaian NGO Hen Mpoano and the Environmental Justice Foundation estimate that around 100,000 tons of fish were sold in 2017, significantly reducing employment opportunities for Ghanaians. This practice would cost the country’s economy about $ 50 million a year. Ghana is struggling to better monitor the “saiko”, but also to fight the techniques of local fishermen, such as illuminating the waters during the night to attract fish and poison them with chemicals, or kill them with dynamite. The government banned artisanal fishing in May and June and will ban trawlers along its coasts in August and September, in order to rebuild the stocks. But everyone in the industry agrees that more needs to be done to remedy the situation. “The biggest challenge we have is that everyone, down to the smallest traditional fisherman, understands and applies the laws passed by the executive”, explains Emmanuel Kwafo, head of law enforcement on fishing in the country. --AFP--
