Mboweni made the announcement during his budget vote speech but was mum on the amount that he was considering giving to the power utility. Mboweni also said that state arms manufacturer Denel, South African Airways and the South African Broadcasting Corporation would receive funding from National Treasury’s reserve funds but with strict conditions: “I must emphasise that this additional government support cannot be a blank cheque to these state owned enterprises.
