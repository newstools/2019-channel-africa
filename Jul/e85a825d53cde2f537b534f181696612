Newly appointed ZACC Chairperson, Loice Matanda-Moyo, told a press conference that corruption was the main cause of economic challenges in Zimbabwe, and vowed the anti-corruption body would work tirelessly to tackle the vice. Matanda-Moyo said ZACC had opened investigations into government ministries, departments, and parastatals that were cited in the recent Auditor General's report for abusing public funds. Some of the parastatals named include power utility ZESA, state grain procurer Grain Marketing Board, national airline Air Zimbabwe and state pension fund National Social Security Authority. "ZACC has opened active investigations in respect of all ministries, government departments, state enterprises and parastatals implicated in the report with a view to bringing to book all those implicated in any or all cases of corruption, theft, misappropriation, abuses of power and other improper conduct," said Matanda-Moyo. She urged the Executive to reduce the powers of ministries over state enterprises and parastatals, saying such ministries had become a cause for concern.
