The move will give Branson’s venture the much-needed capital in the race to space against rivals such as Jeff Bezos’ Blue Origin and Elon Musk’s SpaceX. The company will list its shares as part of a merger with Social Capital Hedosophia Holdings Corp, a special purpose acquisition company, which will take a 49% stake in Virgin Galactic. Following the investment, the combined company will have a pro forma enterprise value of $1.5 billion. Branson founded Virgin Galactic in 2004, and since its early days his ambitious timeline for taking customers into space has suffered delays and setbacks. In February this year, the company took a step closer to its goal of suborbital flights for space tourists when its rocket plane soared to the edge of space with a test passenger for the first time. --Reuters--
