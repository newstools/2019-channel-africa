Michael Christopher was on Monday afternoon seized aboard Kenya Airways flight for Nairobi at Juba International Airport. Christopher said he was forcefully disembarked from the plane by officers from the spy agency, National Security Service (NSS), acting on orders of the “highest authority”. “When I came down, I asked them what’s happening. They told me that they had an order from the highest authority to confiscate my passport and prevent me from travelling,” Christopher told journalists in Juba. He said that his passport was yet to be returned to him. Christopher added that he was going for a workshop in the Kenyan capital. --TheEastAfrican--
