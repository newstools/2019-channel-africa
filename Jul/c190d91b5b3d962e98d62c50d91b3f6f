The loss-making airline, which is 48.9% government-owned and 7.8% held by Air France-KLM (AIRF.PA), was privatized 23 years ago but sank into debt and losses in 2014.  

Lawmakers voted to re-nationalize it this week. "The (transport) ministry needs three months to think through and then give us a proposal on the aviation share holding company and the entire structure," David Pkosing, the chairman of parliament’s transport committee, told Reuters. He estimated buying out shareholders would take 18 months. A failed expansion drive and a slump in air travel forced the airline to restructure $2 billion of debt in 2017. But Kenya Airways still needed cash for fleet and route expansion amid growing competition from Ethiopian and Emirates. Minority shareholders, who hold about 3% of shares, will be bought out for about $7.71 million, Pkosing said. A consortium of local lenders, who acquired 38% of the company’s equity during the 2017 restructuring, could be paid through government debt, possibly 10-year Treasury bonds, Pkosing said.
