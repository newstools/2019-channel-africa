Reuters reported last week that the two sides had been holding talks over Turkey’s vehicle tax regime to conclude the  $1.1 billion investment. The carmaker, which has also considered making the investment in Bulgaria, has not announced a final decision, but sources have said Volkswagen (VOWG_p.DE) is positive about investing in Turkey. Erdogan and a high-ranking VW official overcame most of the problems during a meeting this week, one Turkish source with knowledge of the matter said.  

A Volkswagen source said Erdogan had met with VW Chief Executive Herbert Diess this week. "There were previously some small issues, such as the tax arrangements on the cars that will be sold. In the meeting, an almost complete agreement was reached," the Turkish source said. "If there isn’t a last minute problem, the investment will be made in Turkey." Steep Turkish taxes on larger cars limit most buyers and local producers to smaller engine sizes. Cars with engines of less than 1.6 liters made up 96% of Turkey’s new car market in 2018. 

A source had said Turkey was trying to find a formula to address Volkswagen’s concerns without putting existing car producers at a disadvantage.
