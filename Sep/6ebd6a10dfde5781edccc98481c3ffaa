Nine people died when dozens of gunmen attacked Komsilga village, staying there for several hours. Seven were killed in Deneon village, and a soldier died elsewhere. All the attacks took place on Saturday. Hundreds of people have been killed in northern and eastern Burkina Faso in the past few years, mostly by jihadist groups. A special operation was launched in May in response to the violence, but security has not improved. --BBC--
