The WHO representatives have not provided any evidence to support claims and reports that the Tanzanian government  has refused to share information on suspected Ebola cases in the region. “The government has summoned the representative of the WHO in the country to seek in-depth details from the agency on reports circulating in the media,” government spokesperson, Hassan Abbasi, said on Twitter. This has come after concerns and reports of an outbreak of the Ebola virus in Africa.
