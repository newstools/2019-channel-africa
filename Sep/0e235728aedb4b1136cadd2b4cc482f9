South Africa asked the United Nations to briefly release Ambassador Kingsley Mamabolo to serve as a Special Envoy tasked with briefing African countries on steps taken ationsto combat acts of Xenophobia in the country. A letter seen by SABC News from the Executive Office of the Secretary General says a request from the government, received on September 17th for a leave of absence for Mamabolo to allow him to undertake a national assignment, could not be granted. The letter to the South African Permanent Mission to the UN says the request was turned down pursuant to the advice of the UN Ethics Office that pointed to the UN Charter and UN Regulations that staff members shall not seek or receive instruction from any government or from any other authority external to the UN and shall refrain from any action which might reflect on their position as international officials responsible only to the UN. The Presidency has not responded to requests for clarification.
