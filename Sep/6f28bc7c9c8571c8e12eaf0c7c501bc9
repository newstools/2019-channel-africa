The three-match T20 series - in India - marks the first time the Proteas will play since their Cricket World Cup flop in England earlier this year. The Proteas could only manage three wins from nine matches and finished seventh in the 10-team log. However, Van der Dussen believes the Proteas will bounce back from their tough times in England. "The last time we were together was at the World Cup, it was a disappointing showing by the team and we all knew it," said Van der Dussen on Wednesday in India. "Coming together now, it's a fresh start with new coaching staff and new faces. We've spoken a lot about where we are as a team and where we want to go. "India are one of the strongest teams in the world, it's going to be a massive challenge. They recently played against the West Indies and gave us the advantage of seeing their strategies," said the 30-year-old. "Our guys have been off for a while, but they are fresh and raring to go. We had a disappointing World Cup campaign so now we got the opportunity to make a strong statement and bounce back from that." Van der Dussen also highlighted that the Proteas are beginning their preparations for next year's T20 World Cup in Australia. "There's a T20 World Cup in just over a year, we have 20 games left or so. This will show us exactly where we are, playing against one of the strongest teams."Â
