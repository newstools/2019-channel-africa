The announcement followed a meeting of the carmaker's board on Monday. Earlier, Saikawa told Japanese media he was "keen to pass the torch" when asked if he was preparing to resign. The Nissan boss had come under pressure after saying he had been overpaid as part of a bonus scheme. However, he denied wrongdoing. Board chairpersoin Yasushi Kimura told reporters that Saikawa would quit on 16 September. "After the board discussion, the board asked Saikawa to step down from the chief executive position. Saikawa accepted this," Kimura said. Nissan said it hoped to find a replacement by the end of next month. Chief operating officer Yasuhiro Yamauchi will take on the role temporarily. The 65-year-old had been accused of receiving hundreds of thousands of dollarsâ€™ worth of extra share option payments in 2013. It was the latest twist in a saga plaguing the firm that centres on improper payments to top executives. Following reports that Saikawa was preparing to step down, the Nissan boss told reporters in Japan: "I'm keen to pass the torch to the next generation as soon as possible." He has previously said he would resign in light of slowing sales and falling profits. --BBC--
