The social giant announced on Thursday that it is launching its nascent dating service in the US - a feature that’s been tested in 19 other countries since it was unveiled in May 2018. Users can combine elements of their Facebook and Instagram accounts to create a separate dating profile - the most notable way Facebook has ever combined the two entities from a product perspective. 

Facebook Dating will exist inside Facebook’s main app, but users will be able to pull photos from their Instagram profiles into their dating profile, and by the end of the year be able to publish their Instagram Stories to their dating profile as well.

Facebook daters can also use their Instagram followers for a feature called 'Secret Crush', which could match them with another Facebook Dating user from their Instagram network. 

Users can’t be matched with one of their Facebook friends simply by listing them as a 'secret crush' - an effort to avoid embarrassing or awkward connections.
