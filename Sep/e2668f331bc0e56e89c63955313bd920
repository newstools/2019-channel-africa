His hand closed around a human jawbone. “I just looked at these teeth and I tried to remember my sister’s teeth,” said the 26-year-old American, who handed over the remains to police for identification. Stumo is not alone in finding bones and other remains at the site, about 60 kilometres east of Addis Ababa, where the Boeing 737-MAX slammed into the ground with such force that only fragments of those who died can be recovered. Another victims’ relative told Reuters they had found remains in April. Many of the relatives are now pressing for the farmland where the plane crashed to be turned into a permanent memorial. “Out of respect to the dead, the crash site should be treated as a graveyard,” said Adrian Toole, a Briton whose daughter Joanna died in the crash, the second involving a Boeing 737-MAX in the space of five months. Dozens of families are suing Boeing after preliminary reports into the crash in Ethiopia and the Lion Air incident in Indonesia, which killed 189 people, showed an automated system erroneously pointed the planes’ noses down repeatedly after take-off. Relatives also want the process used to certify the new Boeing model examined by the US Federal Aviation Authority. Some families will demonstrate outside the US Department of Transportation on Tuesday, the six-month anniversary of the Ethiopian crash, to demand greater accountability by the US authorities, said Nadia Milleron, Samya’s mother.
