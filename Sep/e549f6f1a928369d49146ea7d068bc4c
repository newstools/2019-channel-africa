The Ministry of International Affairs and Cooperation is advising all Batswana traveling to South Africa to "exercise extreme caution in light of recent developments resulting in violent unrests".     

The Ministry further cautioned Batswana residing in South Africa to also "avoid areas where unrests are currently occurring and encourages them to remain vigilant at all times". South Africa has experienced a wave of protests, in which communities have looted both foreign and South African owned shops while calling for an end to the presence of drug syndicates, reports News24.         

There have also been reports of counter attacks on South African owned businesses in other African countries in response to the violence. Areas in Gauten have been hardest hit with sporadic violence occurring across all three of its big metros, according to News24. 

The head of strategic communications and member of the World Economic Forum (WEF) executive committee, Olivier Cann also confirmed that Malawi and Rwanda would not be attending the forum.   

This followed claims that several African heads of state would not attend in protest to the current looting and xenophobia-related violence in Gauteng. On Wednesday the Cape Town International Convention Centre, currently hosting the WEF Africa forum was the central point to a massive march, mostly by school children in response to the escalating violence against women in the country.    
 
The protest was largely peaceful, however police used water cannons and stun grenades to disperse the gathering - as they had planned to block the highway until President Cyril Ramaphosa addressed them.
