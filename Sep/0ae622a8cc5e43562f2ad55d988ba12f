From the moment spectators enter Sun City from November 14-17, they will be welcomed to a golf experience that includes the latest VR technology, live activations, and a wide variety of hospitality, entertainment and dining options on par with the biggest tournaments in world golf. "Our whole focus this year is on fan engagement and involving as many spectators in as many different activities as we can, and giving them the opportunity to win what are some truly amazing prizes on offer this year," says Jeanne Visagie, Tournament Operations Manager of the Nedbank Golf Challenge. One of the most anticipated of these activations, which will be announced later, will involve the fans in a way that has never been done before at this tournament and utilising the Nedbank Golf Challenge App to enhance the spectator experience. "It's going to be something totally unique and we are very excited about it," says Visagie. A new Information Kiosk at the Skytrain station in public parking will be the first welcome point for spectators, and tournament personnel will inform them of every possible golf activation and experience they can enjoy. The entrance to the Public Village has been redesigned and will literally guide the spectators into a world-class offering of entertainment and hospitality, and which will again feature the latest VR technology showcasing the incredible history of the Nedbank Golf Challenge.
