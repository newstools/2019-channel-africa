The event will be hosted in London and the hosts, comedian Ola Labib and singer Asya Satti, say they will be celebrating Sudanese culture. "For quite a long time Sudan has been known as this place that has either got sanctions, or dictators, or war. Nobody knows anything about Sudan's culture. So being part of this event, I thought, at last, we can talk about something other than what Sudan has been known in the media," Satti told the BBC. Money raised will be donated to those families who lost relatives. "A lot of people who protested are generally young males, they are usually the bread winners of the family. So families that have lost these people will get the donations," said Labib. Satti added; "The idea is to continue doing these events and festivals to subsidise any grant that these individuals or their families are receiving from the state." Labib said she was optimistic Sudan would turn over a new leaf, though it would take time. "I think people have this image in their head where they are going to go from X to Y really quickly; I don't think it's going to work like that. Stability is the main thing. As long as we can maintain stability - then fine. In regards to development I think it's going to take a long time," she said. --BBC--
