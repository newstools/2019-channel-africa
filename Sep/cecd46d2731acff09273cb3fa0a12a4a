Radu Bancui, who presents a late-evening television show for B1 TV in Romania, was hit with the pretty paltry fine of â‚¬1 700 ($1 881) for comments he made in which he compared Williams to a monkey. "Serena Williams looks like those monkeys at the zoo with the red butt," Banciu said on television, according to CNCD (the National Council for Combatting Discrimination). "If you put some pants over that butt, they look exactly as Serena Williams looks on court." The CNCD was strong in its condemnation, saying in a press release: "Slavery was based, among other things, on comparing black people with monkeys. "Consequently, such statements represent a form of extreme racism."
