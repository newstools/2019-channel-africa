France’s Emmanuel Macron, Russia’s Vladimir Putin and former U.S. president Bill Clinton were among the mourners in the aisles of the Saint Sulpice church for the mass in memory of Chirac, who died last week aged 86. Chirac’s coffin, draped in the French flag, rested at the front of the church after having been driven in a procession escorted by police motorcyclists along streets lined by thousands of Parisians. Chirac, who served as president from 1995 to 2007, was feted by many French people for asserting their country’s role as a global player, a stance that put him at odds with Washington over the invasion of Iraq in 2003. Chirac was from his earliest years a member of the French establishment, but he also had a knack for connecting with ordinary people outside the urban elite. A court conviction after he left office for misusing public funds did little to tarnish his image. “This former president had a true love for people, equally at home in the salons of the Elysee or the living room of a farmer,” Archbishop of Paris Michel Aupetit told the roughly 2 000 people gathered in the church. He said Chirac embodied a love for his fellow man that is missing from today’s society. “Goodbye, and thank you Monsieur Chirac,” Aupetit added.
