Von Zeuner, an independent non-executive director appointed to the group's board in late 2018, will assume the role of chairman on October 1. Sibisi will step down from his position as chair, as well as director, on Sept 30 "having overseen the orderly transition of the board, including the appointment of new directors," the group said in an update to shareholders on Monday. "We are confident that von Zeuner and new directors together will bring new insights, and their contribution will strengthen board oversight as the company embarks on a path of restructuring its business and securing value for its stakeholders on a sustainable basis." --News24--
