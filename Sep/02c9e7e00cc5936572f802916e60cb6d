The former Olympic and world 5000m and 10 000m champion, 37, missed out on Kenyan Eliud Kipchoge's 2:01:39, set in the same race last year. Bekele's run is the second fastest marathon in history. "I am very sorry. I am not lucky. But I still can do this. I don't give up," Bekele said. Kipchoge was absent as he prepares for his sub-two-hour marathon attempt in Vienna on October 12.Â 

Bekele, who set his previous best time 2:03:03 at the 2016 Berlin Marathon, was a second ahead of world-record pace at the halfway point. He slipped to more than a minute behind after 30km of the 42km race, and fell narrowly short of Kipchoge's time despite a sprint finish. Birhanu Legese finished second, 1min 7secs behind Bekele in the third fastest time in history, with Sisay Lemma was a further 48 seconds behind to complete an Ethiopian clean sweep. Ashete Bekere won the women's race in 2:20:14, beating fellow Ethiopian Mare Dibaba by eight seconds in a sprint finish. --BBC--
