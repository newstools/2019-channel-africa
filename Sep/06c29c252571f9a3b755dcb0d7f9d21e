Kamto, 65, and dozens of political allies and supporters face charges of insurrection, hostility to the motherland and rebellion, crimes which could carry the death penalty. He arrived in the court amid tight security with around 200 police in anti-riot gear guarding the intersection in front of the court. Others patrolled the area in pick-up trucks while 50 security troops guarded the entrance to the court following a call by his followers to rally there in protest. Cameroon's former colonial ruler France, the United States and the European Union have been calling for his release from detention for eight months. "There is no justification for Kamto and his supporters to have been incarcerated for eight months in these conditions," their French lawyer Antoine Vey told AFP. "None of them took part in acts of violence, none called for acts of violence or rebellion, there is no reason for their arrest other than a political motive." Kamto, the head of the opposition Movement for the Rebirth of Cameroon (MRC), was arrested in late January after months of peaceful opposition protests over the results of the October 2018 presidential election. The MRC charges the election was rigged in favour of President Paul Biya, who has been in power for 36 years. Kamto believes he won the election. The crackdown on the opposition caused outrage among rights groups and many western governments.
