The $150 million deal will be awarded to Gabon for â€œboth reducing its greenhouse gas emissions from deforestation and degradation, and absorptions of carbon dioxide by natural forests. For the Central African Forest Initiative, it will be the first time that an African nation will be rewarded by other countries for protecting the forests that the entire planet depends on. It should be noted that Gabon has been a leader in Central Africa in preserving its rainforests, creating 13 national parks since 2000 that cover around 11 % of the country. --AfricaNews--
