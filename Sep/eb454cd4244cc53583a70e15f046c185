The General Assembly is one of the six main organs of the UN, where several international issues covered by the Charter of the United Nations, such as development, peace and security, international law are discussed. This year’s assembly which starts on September 17 has climate change, universal health coverage and the politics of sustainable development, on the agenda. There will also be meetings on financing for development, elimination of nuclear weapons and the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Ghana will occupy the first seat in the Hall for this year’s session, including in the main committees, followed by all the other countries, in English alphabetical order. African heads of state including Zimbabwe’s Emmerson Mnangagwa, Egypt’s Adel Fattah el-Sisi, Senegal’s Macky Sall and Democratic Republic of Congo’s Felix Tshisekedi are already in New York for the General Assembly. South Africa’s President, Cyril Ramaphosa will be one of the notable absentees, having opted to deal with pressing domestic issues back home. --AfricaNews--
