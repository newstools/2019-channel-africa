Argentina’s international dollar bonds dropped to record lows, its financial stocks tumbled and risk premia shot up after President Mauricio Macri re-imposed capital controls on Sunday as the country battled to avoid its ninth sovereign default. The about-face by Macri, who had previously lifted many protectionist practices of his predecessor, Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner, came after the government failed to stem heavy investment outflows and to shore up its tumbling currency. MSCI’s All-Country World Index, which tracks shares across 47 countries, was down 0.04% on the day. US markets were shut for a holiday on Monday. European shares ticked higher as surprisingly positive data helped China weather the latest round of tit-for-tat tariffs between the United States and China that came into effect over the weekend. Washington imposed 15% tariffs on a variety of Chinese goods and China began to impose new duties on a $75 billion target list. However, both sides will still meet for talks later this month, US President Donald Trump said. Trade-sensitive German shares were 0.4% higher and the pan-European stocks benchmark index STOXX 600 was up 0.63% by midday in London, beginning September higher. It fell 1.6% in August as the trade war intensified.
