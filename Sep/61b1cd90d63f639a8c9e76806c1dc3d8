Nshima is served with almost every meal in Zambia. Severe hunger has been reported in certain parts of the country following last yearâ€™s poor rainfall. There have been calls to declare the situation a national disaster, a move the government opposes. But the vice-president has said foods such as millet, sweet potatoes, pumpkins and cassava have numerous health benefits, reports the state-owned Zambia Daily Mail. "The gradual shift from predominantly maize-based meals is good for the nation as more nutritious foods will have space at our tables," Wina said in a statement issued on Tuesday by her office. "The switch to more nutritious foods is one of the low-cost and effective ways of addressing stunting and malnutrition in the country. "It will also act as an assurance of food security at domestic and community levels," Wina said. --BBC--
