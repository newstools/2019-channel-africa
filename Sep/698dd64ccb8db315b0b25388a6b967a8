Doctors accused security forces of kidnapping Peter Magombeyi after he went missing for five days. He had organised a series of strikes over poor pay and working conditions. After he was discovered in a dazed and confused state 30km from his home in Zimbabwe's capital Harare, Magombeyi was denied permission to travel to South Africa for medical treatment. He was confined to a hospital room in Harare by police officers even though a court ruled he could leave the country to seek medical treatment. In recent months, there has been a spate of abductions in Zimbabwe by those who are seen as critical of the government. The government has denied abducting him, and suggested the whole thing had been faked. --BBC--
