The blaze swept through a maternity unit of Bachir Bennacer hospital in the city of El-Oued in the early hours of Tuesday morning. Prime Minister Noureddine Bedoui ordered an urgent investigation into the fire, which is not the first at the hospital. Those arrested include the head of the hospital, the maternity management coordinator and the head of the paediatrics, AFP reports. A Cuban nurse has also been detained for "negligence and involuntary homicide", Algeriaâ€™s APS news agency is quoted as saying. --BBC--
