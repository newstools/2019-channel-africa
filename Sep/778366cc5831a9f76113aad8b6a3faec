Nyirenda cited the Zambia senior women’s side’s 2019 COSAFA Women’s Cup and the 2020 Olympic qualifier campaigns. The Copper Queens made their first COSAFA Cup final in Port Elizabeth last month, but lost to South Africa. The team also has technically qualified for the second round of qualifying for Tokyo 2020 after beating Zimbabwe 5-0 in the first leg at the end of August. Followed by a walkover in the return leg after the Mighty Warriors abandoned the fixture due to their own internal issues earlier this month. Nyirenda says things are promising. Nyirenda applauded the South African Football Association (SAFA) for eventually kick starting the National Women’s League in 2019. The former Chipolopolo mentor however believes it may take much longer than it did South Africa, for Zambia to have a women’s league as the men’s divisions structures are also struggling. As far as his club Bakgaga are concerned the coach is worried about the effects of the international break which followed a domestic cup week. The Limpopo side are placed ninth on the Absa premiership log with five points from four league outings.
