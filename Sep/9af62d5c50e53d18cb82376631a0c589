The Irishman finished six shots clear of Tommy Fleetwood at Royal Portrush to lift the Claret Jug in July. It was Lowry's maiden Major Championship triumph and came ten years after his unforgettable breakthrough victory as an amateur at the 2009 Irish Open at County Louth Golf Club in Baltray. The 32-year-old currently leads the European Tour's Race to Dubai, having also won the Abu Dhabi HSBC Championship earlier this year. Lowry was presented with his Honorary Life Membership by European Tour Chief Executive Keith Pelley ahead of the BMW PGA Championship,which gets under way at Wentworth Club in England on Thursday. "It is pretty cool to receive this award. When you start playing golf when you're a kid you don't know how good you can be, or even when you start playing as a pro. I didn't know that I would get to this day so it's pretty cool," said Lowry. "I've obviously joined a nice list of names, which is pretty good as well. My heart lies with The European Tour. I'll always be a member. I love coming back and I love playing in events like this. So it's an extreme privilege to receive this." Keith Pelley, Chief Executive of the European Tour, said: "Shane's incredible victory at Royal Portrush will be remembered as one of the iconic performances in the Championship's storied history... He is also a wonderful ambassador for the European Tour, and is therefore a truly worthy recipient of this honour." Lowry, who has won five times on the European Tour, becomes the 56th person to be awarded Honorary Life Membership of the European Tour.
