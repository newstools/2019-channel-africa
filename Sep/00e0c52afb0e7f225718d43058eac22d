Ayuk Tabe was convicted and sentenced last month on terrorism and secession charges as part of a crackdown on a breakaway rebellion for the country's two English-speaking provinces.    

"We have informed the Appeal Court of our clients' decision to appeal," Joseph Fru, part of a collective of lawyers defending the separatists, told AFP.   

He said the team were currently drawing up the appeal.   

"It appears that the military court handed down a hasty verdict and sentence without giving the accused any meaningful opportunity to defend themselves," said Lewis Mudge, Central Africa director at Human Rights Watch (HRW).        

The military court in Yaounde admitted thousands of pages of statements and documents as evidence against the accused and over 1000 items of forensic evidence, such as guns, spears, and laptops, said HRW, citing the defence team.         

But the defence lawyers were given no prior knowledge of the material and so were unable to effectively challenge it, the group added.         

The trial was also conducted in French without adequate translation, even though the defendants had a legal right to a trial in English, their mother tongue, HRW said.
