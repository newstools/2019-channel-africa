The immense physical destruction can easily be seen from the air, but officials are only now beginning to grasp the devastating personal toll for families who have lost loved ones in. The killer storm, the strongest to ever to make landfall in the country, wiped out many homes, and in some cases, entire neighbourhoods were mashed into rubble. "We expect that this number will increase," Prime Minister Hubert Minnis said at a Wednesday night news conference. Though the Bahamas experiences hurricanes frequently, he said that Dorian, which made landfall as a Category 5, has caused "generational devastation." It will require a massive recovery and relief effort. Now that Dorian's vicious bands of rain and wind are slowly crawling up the southeast United States coast, Bahamians are finally seeing sunlight again. "Nothing compares to what we went through the past two days," survivor Michael Hynes said. "Almost 48 hours now with nonstop carnage." Volunteers are rushing to rescue trapped residents and deliver aid three days after Dorian slammed the country. "There is tremendous human suffering," storm chaser Josh Morgerman said. "These people really need help. They've lost everything." --CNN--
