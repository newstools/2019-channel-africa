The builders were working on the three-storey block when it came down on Wednesday. A hospital official told AFP that more than a dozen people had been injured. The police chief in Bo, Sierra Leone's second city said that 82 people had reported for work to concrete the third floor of the building, but it is not clear how many were inside at the time of collapse. "We have received over a dozen people with injuries," Dr Peter Samai from Bo hospital is quoted by AFP as saying. "Ten of the survivors have severe injuries." It is not clear what caused the building to collapse. --BBC--
