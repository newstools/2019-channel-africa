The duo lapping marginally quicker than championship leader Lewis Hamilton in what could prove to be a precursor for a three-way battle for supremacy on Sunday. Red Bull's Vestappen crossed the line in 1:40.259, just 0.167s ahead of Ferrari's Vettel in a session that was held up by a late crash involving Hamilton's Mercedes team mate Valtteri Bottas which caused the action to be red flagged for 10 minutes. Under overcast yet clear skies as the threat of haze subsided due to changing winds, the late afternoon conditions will be markedly different from those the drivers will experience under the floodlights when they set about qualifying for Sunday's night race.
