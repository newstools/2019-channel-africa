On a tortuous journey, three of the five friends died before reaching Libya, where the two survivors were stranded for almost a year. Now only Gloria is back home in Nigeria. She dreamed of being a fashion designer but now sews synthetic tracksuits in a shabby workshop in Benin City, southern Nigeria, for Â $41.50 a month. "After transport, the money is almost finished", she says. Still, she adds quickly, she "thanks God for having a job". Her employment is part of a training programme, set up by southern Edo State, the departure point for most Nigerian migrants. Gloria is one of nearly 14 000 young Nigerians to have returned from Libya since 2017 under a United Nations voluntary repatriation programme. She and the other returnees quoted in this story asked not to be identified by their real names. She is "not asking for too much", just a roof over her head and to be able to eat, Gloria tells AFP. But she blames herself for daring to dream that life could be better elsewhere and believing the smugglers' promises that they would reach Europe within two weeks.
