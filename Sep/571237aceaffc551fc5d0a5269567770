Six days later he disappeared. His last WhatsApp message said: "I have been kidnapped by 3 men." Magombeyi was found on Thursday night, 30km from the capital Harare. He was alive and deeply traumatised. Around 50 political opponents and unionists have been abducted in Zimbabwe this year. According to Amnesty International, they are victims of a "systematic and brutal crackdown on human rights" by the regime. Hundreds of medics took to the streets this week to demand the authorities investigate Magombeyi's disappearance. "No Peter, no work," chanted the crowds. They accused security forces of kidnapping their colleague for heading the Zimbabwe Hospital Doctors Association (ZHDA). The pressure paid off. Magombeyi appeared "disoriented", said a ZHDA member after he was found, adding that the 26-year old would be examined to determine whether he had been tortured. Since Zimbabwean President Emmerson Mnangagwa came to power in 2017, the regime has "resorted to the same brutal tactics" used by his predecessor Robert Mugabe to "clampdown on human rights", said Amnesty in a statement last month. Magombeyi had launched a strike earlier this month to demand their salaries be pegged to the US dollar in the face of spiralling living costs.
