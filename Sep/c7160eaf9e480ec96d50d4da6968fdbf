The lender had expected its earnings to jump by up to 21%, in a sharp contrast to its peers, who saw a drop in their earnings at home amid a slowing economy. Most South African banks have been struggling in 2019, with the economy suffering its worst contraction in a decade and the unemployment rate hitting an 11-year high, after years of already stagnant growth. Headline earnings per share, the main profit measure in South Africa, stood at 2 545 cents for the period, compared with 2 128 cents a year earlier. The bank’s on-going growth was mainly due to a business model that resonated with South Africans, said Gerrie Fourie, Chief Executive Officer, Capitec. “We’re fortunate to be growing, continuously hiring employees and not retrenching,” he said in a statement. Many South African lenders registered flat or minimal growth in their domestic retail banks, and large traditional lenders have been shuttering branches and cutting jobs in a bid to modernise their operations and bring costs down to compete with a host of new, digital-only rivals. Some analysts were concerned that Capitec, the country’s fifth-largest bank, would be hit by a spike in bad debts. Capitec is more exposed to bad debts as compared with rivals as the bank has focused on lower-income consumers and riskier unsecured lending. The bank’s gross loan book grew by 17% to R60.25 billion ($4.02 billion), Fourie said, adding that the total arrears of up to three months decreased by 11% by the end of August 2019.
