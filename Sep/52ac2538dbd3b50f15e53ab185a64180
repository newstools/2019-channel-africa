Rocks, bricks and rubber bullets lay strewn across the empty streets of Alexandra after mobs plundered the township overnight, burning and looting shops in their path. AFP photographers in Alexandra said police presence remained heavy and officers were still firing rubber bullets to disperse the crowds. Alexandra Township is situated just five kilometres from Sandton, the city's affluent business and shopping district, considered Africa's richest square mile. The township was scene to a second night of urban rioting in Johannesburg, where hundreds of people marched through the streets on Monday in an unusually large expression of anti-foreigner sentiment. More than 90 people were arrested on Monday in connection with the violence and looting of shops in Johannesburg and surrounding areas, the government said. Such violence breaks out sporadically in South Africa where many locals blame immigrants for high unemployment, particularly in manual labour. "They burnt everything," Bangladeshi shop owner Kamrul Hasan, 27, told AFP in Alexandra, adding that his shop gets attacked every three to six months. "All my money is gone. If the (South African) government pays for my plane ticket, I will go back to Bangladesh," he said. --AFP--
