“Denel is actively pursuing a winnable order pipeline of $1.97 billion in the next two years, which will greatly contribute to the financial turnaround and long-term sustainability of the company,” Denel said in a statement. “This includes an imminent export contract, the largest in Denel’s history. This contract, which includes an advance payment of R1.5 billion ($100 million), has the potential to grow Denel’s order stock by 32%,” it said. On Friday Denel received $118 million cash injection from the government to stem a deepening liquidity crunch. ($1 = R15.23) --Reuters--
