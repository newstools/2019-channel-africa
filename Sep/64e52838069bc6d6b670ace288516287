Since winning the Maharashtra Open in Pune in January, injury has blighted Anderson's season, allowing him to only play in four further tournaments, including the Australian Open and Wimbledon. Anderson took to Twitter on Monday to release a statement, saying "I have spoken to my team, consulted with doctors, and we have decided that the best course of action is to take the year off and prepare for 2020." "This will allow me enough time to undergo more rehab processes and get healthy," said Anderson. Anderson has suffered with shoulder and knee problems so far in 2019.
