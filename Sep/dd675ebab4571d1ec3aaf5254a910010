Africa's second biggest economy bounced back from its largest quarterly drop in a decade when it contracted 3.1% in the first three months of 2019. Stats SA said the recovery was mainly driven by the mining industry, which grew 14.4%, the biggest increase since 2016. The secondary sector was boosted by manufacturing while growth in the tertiary sector was driven by financial, real estate and business services, South Africa's single largest industry. The results are expected to ease pressure on President Cyril Ramaphosa who took office in 2018 on a promise to revive the economy by attracting foreign investment and cracking down on corruption. But Africa's most developed economy has been gripped by low growth, mass layoffs and rolling blackouts caused by South Africa's heavily indebted power company Eskom, which generates around 95% of the country's electricity. Unemployment rose to a record 29% IN 2019, with youth joblessness above 50%. Both the agricultural and construction sectors which respectively employ around 5.0 and 3.0% of the population were in recession, said Stats SA. Growth in the mining sector, fuelled by coal, manganese and iron ore sits at odds with South Africa's pledge to peak greenhouse gas emission between 2020 and 2025, which would require a significant reduction in coal-powered stations. --AFP--
