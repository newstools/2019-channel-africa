Nadal came into the season on the back of ankle surgery, and initially struggled for momentum. He battled his way to the Australian Open final, but was comprehensively dominated by Novak Djokovic, and then even struggled to make an impact on clay too initially. He failed to win either of the Monte Carlo Masters or Barcelona Open, usual strongholds of his, and during that time he says he 'seriously thought about' quitting. However, he has won two Grand Slam titles since then, prompting him to reflect on what he might have missed out on. "It has been unforgettable, emotional two weeks," Nadal told Eurosport after winning the US Open last week. "Who would have thought it after Monte Carlo and especially the Barcelona first round. Tough times. I seriously thought about stopping for a season because when you have injuries every week you do not enjoy yourself," he said. "I tried to make a change, to go through the suffering, training and appreciating the little things that I needed to do to fight for the things I wanted to. I had a great team behind and without their confidence, it would have been impossible."
