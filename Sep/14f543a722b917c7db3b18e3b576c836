If higher oil prices lead to increased gasoline prices in Brazil, ethanol would keep its price advantage over the fossil fuel at the pumps, potentially leading to strong demand and good profit margins for cane mills, market participants said. Assuming such a scenario plays out, mills - which already use 75% of cane to produce ethanol and the rest for sugar - would continue to favor ethanol due to better returns, reducing expected sugar production this year, they said. “But it all depends on what Petrobras will do, if it will pass on to gasoline the increase in international oil prices,” said Antonio de Padua Rodrigues, a director at cane industry group Unica. Brazil’s state-controlled oil company Petrobras, or Petróleo Brasileiro SA, has a near-monopoly on refining in the country, defining prices for gasoline and diesel. Two years ago, the company adopted a policy of tracking international oil prices, but it has faced pressure from the government to cap increases as the new administration tries to boost its popularity. A crippling attack here on Saudi Arabia's oil facilities over the weekend slashed global output by 5%, and sent oil prices up over 14% on Monday. 

US intelligence officials said evidence pointed to Iran being behind the attack, raising concerns over a potential response that could further unsettle world markets and global supply.
