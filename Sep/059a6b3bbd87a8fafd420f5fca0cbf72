With the approval, announced on Tuesday, Hyundai avoided a walkout by workers for the first time in eight years. Hyundai’s South Korean workers, who have staged strikes in all but four years since the union was created in 1987, had drawn media and public criticism for threatening to walk out despite their relatively high annual wage of$75.866 on average as of 2018, plus benefits and job security. The deal came with tightened export curbs by Japan threatening to damage Asia’s fourth-biggest economy, weighing on an auto industry already struggling with production cuts and job losses in the face of a slowdown in exports to the United States, Europe and other countries. US automaker General Motors Co (GM.N) last year closed one of its South Korean factories and reduced headcounts, while Renault’s South Korean unit is bracing for production cuts.
