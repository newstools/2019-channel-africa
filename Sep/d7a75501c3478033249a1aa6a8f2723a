A Reuters journalist saw a seriously damaged armored vehicle bearing a small Italian flag sticker in the capital of Mogadishu. It was unclear if there were any casualties. Italy’s defense ministry said in a statement that an Italian military convoy had been hit by an explosion. No injuries had been reported so far, the defense ministry said. Also on Monday morning, there was a bomb attack followed by small arms fire at a base operated by United States special forces, a security source told Reuters. The Baledogle base is where US special forces train Somali commandos and from where many drone operations are launched. Somali police said that two car bombs targeted the base, which houses Somali special forces, US special forces and Ugandan peacekeeping troops. “Two suicide car bombs from the Middle Shabelle region tried to attack Balidogle airport but they detonated outside the airport gate,” Major Abdullahi Nur, a police officer, told Reuters. The bombs were followed by small arms fire, a security source told Reuters. The attack was directed at the US forces on the base, he said. The Balidogle base is in the Lower Shabelle region, about 100 kilometres west of Mogadishu.
