Onyango, 25, was surprisingly released by another PSL club, Maritzburg United, at the end of last season and is a free agent, meaning Pirates could register him outside of the transfer window. He is currently on trial and will hope to impress as Pirates struggle with their defence this season, letting in 12 goals in seven games, the joint worst record in the top-flight along with Cape Town City. Pirates and City played to a 3-3 draw on Saturday afternoon. Onyango was a regular with the Harambee Stars, but has not played for two years. He has been in South Africa for the last six seasons, three with Santos and the latter three at Maritzburg.
