Those requests have been part of a dispute over the final burial of Mugabe, who died on September 6, almost two years after a coup ended his increasingly autocratic 37-year rule. He died during a medical trip to Singapore aged 95, leaving Zimbabweans torn over the legacy of a man who some still laud for his role as a colonial-era liberation hero. Mugabe's burial has already been caught up in a dispute between his family who wanted to bury him at his rural homestead Zvimba and the government, which pushed for the body to rest at a national monument in the capital. They finally agreed Mugabe would be buried at the National Heroes Acre monument, in about 30 days, once a mausoleum was built for him. But Mugabe was a non-practising chief in his homestead, and the burial feud has highlighted the spiritual beliefs, superstitions and rituals surrounding deaths of traditional leaders in parts of Zimbabwe. Once Mugabe's remains were returned to Zvimba on Monday, traditional leaders demanded the burial remain in line with local rites. One of the Zvimba chiefs, Raphael Zvikaramba, said they had "so far" accepted the government's proposal, but refused to comment on the details. "(Zvimba) chiefs are buried in caves and the burial is secretly conducted at night," Mugabe's nephew Dominic Matibiri told AFP, standing outside his late uncle's rural house.
