The endangered black rhinos were moved from Tsavo National Park to protect them from poaching. But they were not able to digest high levels of salt in their drinking water in the park, which led to their deaths. Before the government moved the rhinos, samples of the water had been taken but the results were not considered, the tourism minister said at the time. According to the inquiry, WWF applied pressure on Kenya Wildlife Service (KWS) to speed up the move. WWF has denied the accusations, saying concerns about water quality were never raised. "We would never push for a translocation to go ahead against the recommendations of the relevant experts," the organisation said in a statement. "This was a tragedy we hope will never be repeated." Estimates suggest there are fewer than 5 500 black rhinos in the world, all of them in Africa and some 750 in Kenya. Poaching poses a significant threat to the population. --BBC--
