Team Europe’s Nadal was also scheduled to take on Team World’s Nick Kyrgios in his singles clash and partner Swiss Federer against American duo John Isner and Jack Sock. Federer instead played with Greek Stefanos Tsitsipas and they were beaten by the Americans 5-7 6-4 10-8 to give the World team the lead overall. “I’ve had an amazing time playing at the Laver Cup and I’m so disappointed I’m not able to play again today, but I have some inflammation in my hand and I need to rest,” Nadal said in a statement. “The atmosphere has been amazing in Geneva and of course I’m going to be there courtside today for all my team mates and do everything I can to support them and help Team Europe win the Laver Cup.” Austrian Dominic Thiem stood in to replace Nadal but the day’s schedule was further complicated when Kyrgios also withdrew, captain John McEnroe saying it was a shoulder injury. “Nick’s shoulder has been bugging him. He was talking about it last night,” McEnroe said. “I don’t know what to tell you other than we wanted him to come out 100% and he didn’t feel like he could. So that means we’ve got to put somebody else in.” American Taylor Fritz was Kyrgios’s replacement. US Open Champion Nadal beat Milos Raonic 6-3 7-6(1) in his singles match on Saturday before partnering Tsitsipas in a 6-4 3-6 10-6 defeat by Kyrgios and Sock. Team Europe led 7-5 heading into Sunday with the first side to reach 13 points crowned champions. Each win is worth three points on Sunday. In other singles matches, Federer squares off against Isner while Alexander Zverev meets Raonic. --Reuters--
