The World Trade Organisation has approved a US request to impose tariffs on some European goods in the latest chapter of a two-way dispute over aircraft subsidies which could also lead to European reprisals, two people familiar with the case said. The scope of the decision, which had been widely anticipated, is due to be announced at the end of September. Both sides have won partial rulings in their favor in a 15-year dispute involving billions of dollars of domestic support for planemakers Airbus and Boeing (BA.N).Â But the US is first in line to take action since its case is running about 9 months ahead. Washington has sought permission to target European aircraft and aerospace parts, as well a range of industries including food, wine, tractors and luxury goods, as part of an $11.2 billion package of proposed tariffs against the European Union. The final amount will depend on WTO arbitrators and Washington must then choose from a list of goods totaling more than $20 billion that it has identified as potential targets, before putting tariffs into effect up to the authorized limit.
