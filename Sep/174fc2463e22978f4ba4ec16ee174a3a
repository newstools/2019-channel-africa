Cde Mugabe was an icon of liberation, a pan-Africanist who dedicated his life to the emancipation and empowerment of his people. His contribution to the history of our nation and continent will never be forgotten. May his soul rest in eternal peace @MalcolmJR13: I can't believe we allowed media to fool us into thinking this man was the worst thing that happened to Zimbabwe. #RIPMUGABE #RIPROBERTMUGABE  @AdvBarryRoux: President Robert Mugabe was a greatest leader, He stood against the imperialist forces of UK & USA after the UK failed to honor its Lancaster House agreement. his anti-imperialist kinda leadership makes him a bad person cos imperialists own this world. #RiPRobertMugabe #RiPMugabe  @docfarai: I'm conflicted #RIPMugabe you leave a very complicated legacy. Some will forever admire you as a liberation hero, but many who suffered under your harsh rule will only remember a dictator who ruined a country with great potential. You have run your race now time to face your Maker  @DZumaSambudla: One of our greatest Pan Africanist Leaders...an African for Africans. Rest In Absolute Power! We will tell your story the right way NOT the white way! #RIPMugabe  @Emmanuel_Tsebe: #RipMugabe Let Zimbabweans be the ones praising or blaming Mugabe s leadership, not outsiders @GatsheniMtha: Mugabe was a monster, there is nothing to mourn --Channel Africa--
