On Sunday, a crowd in Johannesburg disrupted a speech by the veteran politician Mangosuthu Buthelezi, who was trying to quell tensions following a recent wave of deadly riots and attacks. A section of the crowd left the venue and marched through the streets calling for foreigners to leave the country. At least 12 people, including two foreign nationals, have been killed in mob violence. --BBC--
