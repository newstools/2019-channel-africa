The case was reported less than four months after North Korea reported its first outbreak in late May. Kim Hyeon-soo, South Korea’s agriculture minister, told reporters on Tuesday that in addition to raising the alert level, nearly 4000 hogs would be culled to prevent the spread of the virus. “We will make all efforts to stop the spread of African swine fever through swift disinfection measures,” Kim said. The ministry also ordered a nationwide movement ban of hogs and related livestock for 48 hours while looking into the source of the virus, he said. African swine fever is highly contagious and nearly 100% fatal to swine herds. It occurs among pigs and wild boars, transmitted by ticks and direct contact between animals. There is no vaccine for the disease, but it does not affect humans. The first outbreak of African swine fever in East Asia was reported in China in early August 2018. Since then, the deadly virus has spread to all Chinese provinces and regions, as well as to other Asian nations, including Vietnam and the Philippines. South Korea, Asia’s fourth-largest economy, does not import any pork products or live pigs from China due to China’s history of foot-and-mouth disease outbreaks. It mainly imports from the United States and Germany, and pork imports account for about a third of the country’s total pork supplies. Although this is the first time African swine fever has hit South Korea, an incidence of foot-and-mouth disease was confirmed in March 2018 at a hog farm, the country’s first discovery since February 2017.
