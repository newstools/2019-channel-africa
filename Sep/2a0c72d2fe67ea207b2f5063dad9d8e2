Tabichi, a member of the Franciscan religious order, won the 2019 Global Teacher Prize in March. He teaches science at Keriko Mixed Day Secondary School in Kenya's Nakuru county, located 188km (116 miles) north-west of the capital, Nairobi. A picture of their meeting in the Oval office was posted on Twitter by the White House press secretary, who said Tabichi gave "away 80% of his monthly income to help the poor in his home country of Kenya": Tabichi is expected to recite a prayer before the General Assembly opens in New York later on Tuesday, Kenya's Daily Nation newspaper reports. He is also due to give brief remarks on how he made it to the top in the teaching profession.
