The Rand strengthened to around R14.92/$ by mid-day thanks to optimism regarding a resolution to the US-China trade war, which helped lift emerging market FX. 

However, following the release of weak job data in South Africa, the Rand reverted to its depreciatory trend, teetering just near the R15/$ mark threshold near the end of the trading day. 

At the close of local trade, the Rand quoted 0.29% weaker at R15.02/$, after trading in range of R14.93/$ - R15.08/$. The Rand traded little changed overnight. Expected range today R14.85/$ - R15.15/$.

The JSE All Share (+0.72%) advanced yesterday, led by gains in large banking stocks after the Labour Court blocked what would have been the largest banking strike in almost 100 years. 

In local news, Capitec (+0.44%) reported a 20% profit for the six months ended 31 August 2019. 

Results were in line with expectations, with earnings buoyed by robust customer growth. In the overall emerging market sphere, the MSCI Emerging Market Index (+0.37%) traded higher.
