The former Manchester United striker appeared to be the target of monkey chants from the home crowd at the Sardegna Arena as he prepared to take the decisive spot kick. Former Juventus forward, Moise Kean, was also on the receiving end of racist abuse by Cagliari fans at the same stadium last season. The 26-year-old Lukaku sent goalkeeper Robin Olsen the wrong way with 20 minutes remaining to mark his second goal in as many games for his new club before turning to glare at the home fans responsible for the taunts. “I think that in Italy we must improve a lot and be more educated and respectful towards those doing their job,” Inter coach Antonio Conte told a news conference. “In other countries you support the team, you don’t insult the opposition like this. There must be the maximum respect. Today I was treated well and wasn’t insulted, other times it hasn’t happened like that and it’s not nice.” Lautaro Martinez had opened the scoring just before the half-hour only for the hosts to level through Joao Pedro soon after the break. --Reuters--
