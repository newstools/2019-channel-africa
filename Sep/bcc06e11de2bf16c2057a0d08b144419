The 11 politicians and 17 journalists were arrested in 2001 after criticising President Isaias Afwerki, who has governed since Eritrea became an independent country in 1993. The politicians were arrested for writing an open letter to the President asking him to respect the constitution, which was ratified in 1997 but never implemented and hold elections. The 17 journalists were arrested for reporting on the joint letter. “It is a travesty that this appalling injustice persists almost two decades on, more so now that Eritrea is a member of the United Nations Human Rights Council,” said Amnesty International’s Seif Magango in a statement. The London-based rights group is starting a 18-day social media campaign calling for their release on the 18th anniversary of the arrest of Berhane Abrehe, the country’s former Finance Minister who had just published a book calling on Eritreans to peacefully campaign for democracy. “The extent of injustice flagrantly displayed by President Isaias Afwerki and his government against these detainees and other prisoners of conscience remains deeply concerning," said Magango. "The world must stand with the victims and their families and not tire in calling on the Eritrean authorities to release them immediately and unconditionally." Last year the BBC interviewed Ibrahim Sherifo, whose parents were among those arrested in September 2001 when he was 13 years old. His mother, Aster Fissehatsion, and his father, Mahmoud Ahmed Sherifo, were then prominent politicians. "The memory still haunts me, that black Tuesday in September 2001, that day changed my life forever," he told the BBC Tigrinya service. "I woke up before the crack of dawn to the sound of pounding boots and shouted commands. Running out in the yard, I was just in time to see my mother being dragged from the house by soldiers." --BBC--
