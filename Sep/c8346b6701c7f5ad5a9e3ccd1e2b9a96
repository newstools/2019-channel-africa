Smalling, who has 31 caps for England, made 323 appearances for United during nine years at Old Trafford, winning the Premier League twice.

"This is an opportunity that came to me that I was very interested in, and I was very eager to come," the 29-year-old defender said during his official presentation in Rome. "To have a chance at a big club, if it prolongs and the club is happy and I am happy, then I can definitely see a longer term future in Italy. "Serie A has always been a goal of mine. "In England we don't have many players who do go abroad, but I've always had a desire deep down to experience this and to have the opportunity to go to a big club with big aspirations." Â
