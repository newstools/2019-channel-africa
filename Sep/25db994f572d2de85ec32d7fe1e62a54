Striker Thievy Bifouma, who plays at Yeni Malatyaspor in Turkey, is injured while Prince Oniangué, from French Ligue 2 club Caen, and Delvin Ndinga, who is out of contract and without a club, have both quit their international careers. The trio have been the backbone of the Congo team over the last years but the 19-man squad will have to do without them for the games against Thailand on October 10 in Bangkok and then against Malaysia on October 15 in Kuala Lumpur. Congo’s last game was at the end of the 2019 Africa Cup of Nations qualifying in March when they lost 2-0 away to Zimbabwe in Harare. The trip to Asia serves as warm-up for the start of the 2021 qualifiers where Congo start away to Senegal and then host Guinea Bissau in Group I in November. Coach Valdo has named a first call-up in two years to winger Mavis Tchibota, who plays in Bulgaria but left out German-based Silvère Ganvoula and Dylan Saint-Louis from Belgian club Beerschot. --AllAfrica--
