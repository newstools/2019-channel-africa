The 27-year-old Czech won the inaugural Zhengzhou Open on Sunday, adding to trophies won in Brisbane, Rome and Eastbourne, and will make her fourth appearance in the October 27-November 3 Finals which offer $14 million in prize money. "It's always a goal of mine to qualify for the WTA Finals, and I'm proud to have done it for my fourth time. I look forward to competing against the best players of the season," Pliskova told the WTA website. The big-serving Czech reached the semi-finals of the last two editions of the tournament held in Singapore, losing to eventual winner Caroline Wozniacki in 2017 and runner-up Sloane Stephens last year. The top eight singles players will face off in a round-robin format with the winner taking home the Billie Jean King Trophy. --Reuters--
