The lunchtime meeting in Luxembourg will be the first time the pair have met since the PM took office in July. A Downing Street source says Johnson will stress he wants to secure a deal by 18 October, after a key European Union (EU) summit. But if not possible he will "reject any delay offered" and leave with no deal. The source said Johnson "would make clear that he would not countenance any more delays". They added: "Any further extension would be a huge mistake. It is not just a question of the extra dither and delay, it is also the additional long months of rancour and division, and all at huge expense." The EU's Chief Brexit Negotiator, Michel Barnier, will also attend the meeting in Luxembourg, while Johnson will be accompanied by Brexit Secretary Steve Barclay and Downing Street's Brexit representative David Frost. --BBC--
