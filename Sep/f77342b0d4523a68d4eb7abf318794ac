"Sudan is pluralistic," the religious affairs minister of Sudan's new government said when announcing the decision. "It’s happened in other Middle and North African countries so it’s not completely unheard of," says author Daisy Abboudi, the daughter of Sudanese Jews. "It’s a very positive first step." “The reason it was so interesting and unique is because it's a mixture of Jews from all over the Middle East, and they also adopted the culture and traditions of Sudan." She says their cosmopolitan culture has been passed on through food, with dishes like molokhia - and in nursery rhymes. Many of Sudan's Jews had come to the country in the late 19th and early 20th Centuries, but a small community existed even before that. Jewish people later left because they were targeted amid tensions following the creation of Israel, Abboudia says. "There were a few accusations, such as espionage, all completely false. Then in 1967 there was a six-day war with Israel and all the young Jewish men who were left in Sudan were arrested without charge and detained for a few days, until the war was over and they were released. "And that was really the final point when anyone who was left thought 'we have to leave'." --BBC--
