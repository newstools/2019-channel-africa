The Constitutional Court has confirmed the 2017 judgment of the High Court in Johannesburg, which ruled that disciplining children physically is unconstitutional.

Freedom of Religion South Africa approached the Constitutional Court to challenge this ruling while child rights groups, and others, pushed for its confirmation.

Delivering the unanimous judgment, Chief Justice Mogoeng Mogoeng said that there are other ways of effectively disciplining children and parents can no longer use the rod.
