US sprinter Coleman, who blasted to a brilliant gold medal in the 100m on Saturday, had been due to take part in the heats of the 200m. However a revised start list for the event at the Khalifa Stadium showed the American's name absent. A USATF spokesperson later confirmed Coleman was not racing the event but would be available for the relays. No reason for his 200m withdrawal was given. --Sport24--
