This is blamed on the exit of its key client FastJet Tanzania, a low-cost carrier as well as stiff competition from the national carrier's new ground handling firm. The Dar es Salaam Stock Exchange listed company’s 2019 half-year results show net profits dropped to $991,776, from $2.15 million reported in 2018. Revenues fell to $7.5 million from $10.9 million and operating costs to $6.1 million from $7.67 million. The firm attributes the drop in revenue to a reduction in business and flight frequencies “by some of our airline customers.” The Tanzania Civil Aviation Authority (TCAA) gave NAS-Dar Airco the nod to operate at the Julius Nyerere International Airport in order to meet the rising demand for ground handling services. Swissport Tanzania Ltd, a subsidiary of Swissport International, dominates the business in the country. With the exit of Fastjet Tanzania, a key client of Swissport, and the entry of NAS-Dar Airco which is handling Air Tanzania’s ground handling services, business has been thinning for the Swiss firm. --TheEastAfrican--
