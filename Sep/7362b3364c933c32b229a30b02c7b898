Naledi Pandor was addressing the United Nations General Assembly Saturday. “The incidents of violence and looting that erupted in parts of our provinces of Gauteng and KwaZulu-Natal were regrettable and shameful for a nation with such a proud history of struggle and international solidarity support”. “The government of South Africa strongly condemned these tragic actions and is working hard at ensuring we address the security lapses and intolerance that led to this violence”, Pandor told the Assembly. About 3000 women were killed in South Africa in 2018. That’s one woman gone every three hours. This is more than five times higher than the global average, the World Health Organisation said. According to local reports, some 500 persons were arrested following a recent spate of xenophobic attacks that led to the killing of at least 7 people. Meanwhile, the Southern African nation has supported plans by the United Nations to celebrate its former leader, Nelson Mandela. --AfricaNews--
