Africa’s most industrialised economy had FDI inflows of R26.3 billion ($1.76 billion) in the second quarter from inflows of R11.7 billion ($78 million) in the first three months of the year, the South African Reserve Bank (SARB) said in its Quarterly Bulletin. The country registered portfolio investment inflows of R10 billion ($67 million) from April to June from inflows of R29.2 billion ($1.95 billion) in the prior quarter, the SARB said. South Africa relies heavily on foreign money to cover its large budget and current account deficits, with data showing that foreign investors held 37.3% of South African government bonds as of August. But investor confidence in South Africa remains fragile, while the economic growth outlook is clouded by a lack of clarity and progress on reforms. The financial account of South Africa’s balance of payments recorded an inflow of capital of R13.2 billion ($88 million), or 1% of GDP, in the second quarter from R24.1 billion ($1.61 billion) in the first quarter. --Reuters--
