If the project is completed within a period of six months, as widely anticipated, it will help ameliorate the crippling power crisis buffeting the entire economy. This comes after RioZim earlier this year signed a US$200 million agreement with Chinese firm, China Gezhouba Group International Engineering Corporation (CGGC) to build three solar plants with combined output of 178MW. The agreement signed in May this year will result in phased construction of solar power stations, to be built in different locations, that will provide power to the group’s mining operations namely Renco, Cam and Motor and Dalny Mine. Highly placed company sources told The Herald Finance and Businessthat the diversified miner had agreed terms with Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (ICBC) to fund 85% of the project. Standard Bank China is reportedly also expected to provide part of the project finance amounting to 15% of the total project cost of $200 million. “The project is moving very well and is on course. In fact, term sheets have been agreed with ICBC to provide 85% of the funding. Standard Bank will also make 15% contribution to project finance,” the source said. Chief Executive, Bheki Nkomo, could not be reached for comment on Friday last week but is previously on record saying the project will be among the biggest on the continent and will not only feed RioZim, but also the national grid. --Herald--
