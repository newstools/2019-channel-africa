Almost two-thirds of its profit came from FNB, with the rest from RMB (25%), Westbank (7%) and its various other businesses, including the Aldermore Bank in the UK. FNB saw strong growth in non-interest revenue thanks to increased transactional volumes, and “high-quality” net interest income from growing deposits, with its normalised profit up 11% to $1 billion. This is despite a 55% increase in non-performing loans (where borrowers have fallen far behind on repayments). On personal loans alone, this cost FNB more than $34million, which is 63% higher than the cost in the previous year. The higher write-offs were large expected, given the 36% growth in its personal loan book. FNB card impairments increased by $23 million, with “non-performing” credit almost doubling as the bank extended cards to new customers, some of whom haven’t had credit cards before. "As part of its focus on acquiring new customers and cross-selling credit cards into its base, FNB saw strong book growth from new-to-bank and new-to-product origination strategies. FNB implemented significant risk cutbacks; however, these cuts were delayed in certain cohorts."
