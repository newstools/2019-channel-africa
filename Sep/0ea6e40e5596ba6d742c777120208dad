The late Mugabe, through the fast track land reform programme, had barred white farmers, with exception of a connected few, from land ownership in the country. He also cautioned newly re-settled black Zimbabweans - who were allegedly accommodating former white commercial farmers who lost their properties during the land reforms, and were now entering into farming contracts with displaced white farmers - that they risked losing their land to government. But the new administration, led by his former deputy President, Emmerson Mnangagwa, is now introducing change. In a National Investment Policy, launched by Mnangagwa on August 29, 2019, farm land leases will be given to willing investors regardless of race. Investors into agriculture, under the new National Investment Policy, are guaranteed security of tenure, with access to land through issuance of new 99-year leases, "now de-racialised", reads the NIP in part. The new policy also says it recognises Bilateral Investment Treaties and will engage "investors where violations were made with regards to land with a view to reaching amicable settlements. Accordingly the Government of Zimbabwe will respect and honour its obligations under various Bilateral Investment Treaties," reads the NIP. This is in addition to the southern African country having agreed to compensate farmers who lost their investments following land distribution.
