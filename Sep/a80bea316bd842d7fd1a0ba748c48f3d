The League believes government is being complacent in dealing with issues that affect women. The stance follows President Cyril Ramaphosa’s silence after the country was rocked by a series of kidnappings, rape and murdering of women and children. ANC National Executive Committee member, Nomvula Mokonyane, says as the Women’s League they are calling on government to declare gender-based violence as a state of emergency. Mokonyane says even Parliament has to be involved in the fight against the abuse and violence against women and children through a legislative process. “There is a Women’s Caucus in Parliament, this matter must receive attention there. We have learnt from the late honourable member, Dr Mario Oriani Ambrosini that it is best practice. "This is one of the things we would want to take to the Women’s Caucus in Parliament so that we make something that is much more tangible in ensuring that the legislative environment really becomes responsive to the issues that affect women,” adds Mokonyane. --SABC--
