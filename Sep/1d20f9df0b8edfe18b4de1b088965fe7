Equity, which already runs another subsidiary in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), said the talks were likely to result in a cash transaction. The Kenyan bank did not identify the BCDC shareholders or the size of the proposed deal. 

A combination would create the country's second largest bank with assets of more than $1 billion, said Nairobi-based analyst George Bodo. The DRC market is mainly focused on serving big companies with operations there, making it necessary to have a big balance sheet to be able to compete and grow Bodo said. Rawbank is the leading commercial bank in DRC. In April, Equity bolstered its African presence by announcing the purchase of shares in banks in Rwanda, Zambia, Mozambique and Tanzania, buying the assets of London-listed financial services firm Atlas Mara.
