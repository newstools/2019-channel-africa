Sanctions have barely affected Iran’s exports of oil products, primarily fuel oil used for power generation and shipping as well as liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) used as cooking gas and petrochemical feed. Iran’s product exports reached their highest level in August, Oil Minister Bijan Zanganeh was quoted as saying by a lawmaker after a parliamentary meeting on August 27. “In exports of products we have no problem,” Zanganeh was cited as saying. Consultancy FGE estimates Iran’s product exports at 400 000-500 000 barrels per day, exceeding the top end of crude export estimates by other analysts of some 400 000 bpd for July. Refinitiv Eikon data shows Iran exported more than 230 000 bpd of fuel oil in August, all to the United Arab Emirates, slightly above July’s figure of 220 000 bpd. At current prices and assuming Iran is not selling at a big discount, such sales generate over $300 million a month.
Data intelligence firm Kpler says Iran exported 514 000 tonnes of LPG in July, or nearly 200 000 bpd, worth over $180 million at market prices. 

This compares with 579 000 tonnes in June. China accounted for more than 95% of Iranian LPG exports in June, according to Kpler.
