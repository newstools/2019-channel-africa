Mozambique said in May it had agreed a restructuring deal “in principle” with the majority of holders of the $727 million notes maturing in 2023 MZ139100352= after a hidden debt scandal in 2016 prompted the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and foreign donors to cut off support, triggering a currency collapse and a default on the country’s sovereign debt. One of the world’s poorest countries, Mozambique is also trying to restructure other chunks of its debt, which has seen its debt-to-GDP ratio hit 113%, IMF data shows. For the Eurobond overhaul, it needed the consent of at least 75% to push through its planned restructuring and in a statement on Monday the government said it expected settlement to "occur on or around September 30, 2019." The restructuring will see the issuance of $900 million of new bonds maturing in 2031. The amortizing bond comes with an interest rate of 5% up to September 2023 and thereafter 9% until maturity. The proposal also includes up to $40 million in cash payments. Despite objections by creditors that they had to undergo a second restructuring in around three years, the debt swap plan was seen by many as investor friendly.
