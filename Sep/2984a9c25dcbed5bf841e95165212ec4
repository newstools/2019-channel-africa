In 2016, Zuma was told by the Constitutional Court that he had breached the constitution by not paying back some of the $23 million the government spent on upgrading his private home. A report from the government watchdog said that not all of the upgrades, an amphitheatre, swimming pool and cattle enclosure, related to security. To pay the money back, Zuma borrowed $500 000 from the VBS bank News24 reports. But court papers, seen by News24 and TimesLive, relating to the liquidation of VBS, show that the former president has failed to keep up with the loan repayments. Zuma first went into arrears in August last year and has since made "sporadic repayments, all of which were less than the agreed monthly instalments," TimesLive quotes the court papers as saying. He is currently $38 000 in arrears, the court papers say. The VBS liquidators want Zuma to pay up and if he fails they could seize his Nkandla homestead. Zuma has until Saturday to respond. TimesLive quotes his spokesperson as saying that he is waiting for Zuma's legal team to comment. --BBC--
