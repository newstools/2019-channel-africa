At least eight women have been found strangled in different hotel rooms in Nigeria’s oil capital in Rivers state since July. Outrage over the killings has prompted a social media campaign, using the hashtags #ProtectPHWomen and #ProtectPhGirls, to demand that the authorities do more to stop them. Police told the BBC one man was arrested after a tip-off that he had offered around $80 (£70) to spend the night with a woman. The other suspect had been arrested in Kaduna in central Nigeria. Rivers State Police Chief, Mustapha Dandaura, says a special task force, including the police, hotel associations and the tourism board, had been set up to improve security at hotels in Rivers state. Any hotel that did not comply with new guidelines, which include installing CCTV cameras and asking guests for documentation when registering, would be closed down, he said.
