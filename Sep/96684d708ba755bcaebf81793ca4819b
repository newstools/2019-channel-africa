Chirac was president of France from 1995-2007. Under his presidency, France entered into the single European currency and abolished compulsory military service. Chirac also cut the presidential term of office from seven to five years. Chirac also opposed the 2003 U.S-led invasion of Iraq. The French National Assembly observed a minute's silence in his memory. A towering figure in French politics for five decades, Chirac will be remembered for his opposition to the US-led invasion of Iraq in 2003, his pragmatic statesmanship and his advocacy of the European Union. French President Emmanuel Macron was expected to speak on television at 20:00 local time (18:00 GMT) to pay tribute to his late predecessor. Jean-Claude Juncker, the president of the European Commission and former Luxembourg prime minister, said he was "moved and devastated" to learn the news. "Europe is not only losing a great statesman, but the president is losing a great friend," he said in a statement. German Chancellor Angela Merkel said she was "very sad" to hear about the death of Chirac, who she described as an "outstanding partner and friend". Former French President Fran√ßois Hollande also paid homage to Chirac: "I know that today, the French people, whatever their convictions, have just lost a friend," he said in a statement. Another former French President, Nicolas Sarkozy, said on learning the news: "A part of my life has disappeared today", adding that Chirac "embodied a France faithful to its universal values". A known admirer of Chirac, Russian President Vladimir Putin, praised the "wise and far-sighted statesman" for his "intellect and huge knowledge". British prime ministers past and present were among those to pay their respect, with John Major and Boris Johnson both hailing his political prowess. --BBC--
