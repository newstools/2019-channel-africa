This was revealed by Registrar General, Clemence Masango, during a  tour of the passport production centre, by the Parliamentary Portfolio Committee on Home Affairs. 

Home Affairs Minister, Cain Mathema, earlier last month promised the nation that government will soon be producing 3 000 passports per day but Masango said they are only capable of producing 750 due to lack of consumable.
