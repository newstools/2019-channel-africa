Security forces have stepped up their presence in central Cairo, human rights monitors said on Monday. In a rare public display of dissent, hundreds of people demonstrated in the capital and other cities on Friday in response to calls for protests against alleged government corruption. The protests spread to the Red Sea city of Suez on Saturday, residents said. Defying a ban on protests, the demonstrators shouted slogans calling on Sisi to relinquish power. In the past few days, 373 people have been arrested in Cairo, said Mohamed Lotfy, director of the Egyptian Commission for Rights and Freedoms (ECRF). Gamal Eid, director of the Arab Network for Human Rights Information, said the number of detentions had risen above 400. "Our lawyers can't keep up," he said. Sisi, a former army chief who came to power after the overthrow of President Mohamed Mursi, an Islamist, in 2013 has overseen a crackdown on political dissent that has targeted liberal activists as well as Islamists. His supporters say the crackdown was necessary to stabilise Egypt after the 2011 uprising that toppled former strongman Hosni Mubarak. The new unrest hit Egyptian financial markets. The EGX 30and EGX 100 stock markets both fell by more than 5% on Sunday, their biggest single-day drops in several years. Losses slowed on Monday, with the EGX 100 falling 1.72% and the EGX 30 dropping 1.47%. Egyptian dollar bonds issued by the government and the Egyptian pound in forward markets both slipped. Demand for 10-year Egyptian bonds also dipped slightly. The events over the weekend would "give cause for investors to re-price near-term political risks in Egypt", Farouk Soussa, senior economist with Goldman Sachs, said in research note. "We think that the impact in external and domestic bond markets in the coming day or two may be more acute, given the high participation of international investors in these markets." --Reuters--
