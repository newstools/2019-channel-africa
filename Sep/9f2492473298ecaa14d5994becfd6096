The Attorney General's Office says 1.2 million people were forced to flee their homes. Although the violence has subsided, tensions between rival ethnic groups, mostly over access to land, remain Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed's greatest challenge. Earlier this year the government was criticised by some rights groups for forcing some of the displaced to return to their home areas even when they did not feel it was safe to do so. Ethiopia is made up of nine different self-governing ethnic regions. In 2018 close to three million Ethiopians were displaced by conflict, the highest figure recorded worldwide. --BBC--
