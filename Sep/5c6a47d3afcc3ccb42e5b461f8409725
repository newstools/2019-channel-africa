China’s Commerce Ministry said its trade team will hold talks with their US counterparts in mid-September in preparation for high level negotiations in early October. Shares of chipmakers, sensitive to tariffs, rose in premarket trading, with Intel Corp (INTC.O), Advanced Micro Devices Inc (AMD.O) and Nvidia Corp (NVDA.O) gaining between 1.2% and 2%. Industrial bellwethers Boeing Co (BA.N) and Caterpillar Inc (CAT.N) rose over 1% each. Apple Inc (AAPL.O) led the FAANG group of stocks higher, gaining 1.1%, while Facebook Inc (FB.O), Alphabet Inc (GOOGL.O), Netflix Inc (NFLX.O) and Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O) rose between 0.8% and 1%. Wall Street came under pressure at the start of the week as Beijing and Washington began slapping tariffs on each other’s good as well as data that showed a contraction in U.S. factory activity in August. The trade dispute, which began over a year ago, has dented global economic activity and roiled financial markets. Investors are now pinning hopes on central banks to step in and ease monetary policy to help boost growth. Market participants are currently expecting a quarter percentage point cut in interest rates by the Federal Reserve at its mid-September meeting.
