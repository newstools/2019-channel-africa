Mobs attacked foreign-owned shops and other businesses in the commercial capital, Johannesburg, as well as other cities. The trouble began just over a fortnight ago and lasted for several days. Twelve people were killed in the violence, 10 of whom were South Africans, officials say. In an impromptu interview, the BBC's Milton Nkosi asked the president if he felt ashamed by the violence. "Yes. We are very concerned and of course as a nation we would be ashamed because this goes against the ethos of what South Africa stands for," he responded. Ramaphosa spoke to the BBC shortly before he sent a team of envoys to visit seven African countries to emphasise that South Africans believes in pan-African values. The recent violence has tarnished South Africa's reputation in the rest of the continent. As a sign of that, Ramaphosa was booed in Harare when he gave his eulogy at the state funeral for Zimbabwe's former President Robert Mugabe. But speaking to the BBC, he explained how he wanted his country to be seen. --BBC--
