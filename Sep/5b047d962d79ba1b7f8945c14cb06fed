The potential closures, which Jan Oberholzer said could cut a tenth of the state firm’s 45 000 MW production capacity, piles pressure on the government which has had to bail out the debt-ridden company to keep it afloat. Africa’s biggest public utility supplies over 90% of South Africa’s electricity, relying largely on ageing, heavily polluting coal-fired power stations but does not generate enough cash to meet its debt servicing costs. It is also responsible for at least a third of the country’s greenhouse gas emissions. Installing the technology needed to reduce carbon and sulphur emissions would cost 10 times the R26 billion ($1.7 billion) the Treasury has earmarked for Eskom in the financial year ending in March 2020, part of a R59 ($3.9 billion) two-year package. That package is on top of a R23 billion ($1.5 billion) a year bailout for the next three years. “If we were to press a button today and solve all these (emissions) troubles, it would cost us R300 billion ($20 billion). But as you know we do not have money,” Eskom’s acting Chief Executive and Chairperson, Jabu Mabuza told reporters. Eskom has therefore applied to the Department of Environmental Affairs for rolling postponements of its obligations to meet the emissions and air standards. “If we don’t fix this and reduce our emissions, there’s a risk that we have to shut down some of the power stations,” Oberholzer told a press briefing. “Have we done the work we said we would? No we haven’t.” Oberholzer did not say when Eskom’s failure to meet emissions requirements might trigger plant closures. ($1 = R15.23) --Reuters--
