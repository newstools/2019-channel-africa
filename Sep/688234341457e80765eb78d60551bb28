Deusdimar Tenharim estimates that about 60 000 hectares of the protected land where his people hunt and gather has been burned during the fires - and the blazes are not out yet. "Our firemen are not being able to handle it, the trees where we pick Brazil nuts are gone," he said. The vice-chief explained that the nuts are sold in nearby towns, and used for rituals and medicine. "They are sacred to us, and we already know that next year, 2020, it will be harder to find them in the jungle," he said. In August, Brazil’s space research agency, INPE, announced that the number of fires in the Amazon was the highest since 2010. That sparked international calls for the country to do more to protect the world’s largest tropical rainforest from deforestation and other threats. The forest is considered key to holding the line on global climate change, and the evaporation it produces drives rainfall crucial for agriculture across a broad swathe of South America, scientists say. The Tenharim indigenous territory lies between two medium-sized towns in Amazonas state, and occupies a total of 1.8 million hectares. It is home to several Amazonian tribes. Deusdimar, of Pakyri, said he has no doubt the fires his tribe is facing are man-made. Trained as a firefighter himself, he said it is clear when a fire is natural, judging in part by where it starts - and these fires are not natural in his view. "This is all due to ambition," he said. Farmers are burning forest to open up farmland and "we are hurt directly and indirectly". Brazil nuts are not the only resource going up in smoke either.
