Signs of moderating job growth were also corroborated by another report on Tuesday showing a drop in vacancies at small businesses in August. The reports came on the heels of data last week showing hiring slowed in August. The cool-off in job growth is in tandem with a slowing economy, which is being hampered by a yearlong trade war between the US and China. “Last week’s jobs report sparked a debate over whether the slowdown in hiring is due to an economy hitting full employment, but today’s JOLTS report indicates that this is actually a labour market that is losing momentum,” said Nick Bunker, Economist at Indeed Hiring Lab in Washington. Job openings, a measure of labour demand, slipped by 31 000 to a seasonally adjusted 7.2 million in July, the Labor Department said in its monthly Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey, or JOLTS. Job openings have been little changed this year since scaling an all-time high of 7.6 million in late 2018. Vacancies in wholesale trade decreased by 55 000 in July. Federal government job openings fell by 11000. There were small decreases in unfilled positions in financial activities, professional services and healthcare and social assistance. But job openings increased by 42 000 in information. There were an additional 11 000 vacancies in mining and logging. The job openings rate fell to 4.5% in July from 4.6% in June. --Reuters--
