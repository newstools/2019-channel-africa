German soldiers slaughtered some 65 000 Herero and 10 000 Nama members in a 1904-1908 campaign after a revolt against land seizures by colonists in what historians and the United Nations have long called the first genocide of the 20th century. While Germany has previously acknowledged “moral responsibility” for the killings, it has avoided making an official apology for the massacres to avoid compensation claims. On a trip to the southern African nation, Development Minister Gerd Mueller reiterated Germany’s historic responsibility in Namibia. “It is our job not to forget but to work through the German colonial history and strengthen the reconciliation process,” he said on his visit, which ends on Monday. “It is in the meantime clear that the crimes and abominations from 1904 to 1908 were what we today describe as genocide,” Mueller said after meeting tribespeople on Friday, according to a ministry spokesperson. The spokesperson said some other senior politicians, including the premier of the northern German state of Schleswig Holstein, had also previously used the word genocide, but he was unaware of any other ministers doing so. A Foreign Ministry spokeswoman said the German government was in talks with Namibia about how to work through Germany’s colonial history. “We are in talks, we have agreed confidentiality and hope that we are making progress,” she said. There was no immediate reaction from Namibian officials or tribes people’s representatives to Mueller’s comment.
