They have presented their final report before the International Human Rights Council in Geneva. Investigators found that opposition members, their families and people who have not co-operated with the ruling party ahead of next year's elections have been killed, abducted or tortured.

A representative of the Burundian government Tabu Renovat dismissed the findings as politically motivated.
