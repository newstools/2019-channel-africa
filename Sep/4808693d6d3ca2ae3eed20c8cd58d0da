Modestus Kipilimba was dismissed as director general of the Tanzania Intelligence and Security Service (TISS) after three years in the post. No reason was given. “President John Magufuli today appointed and swore in Diwani Athuman Msuya as director general of national intelligence,” the presidency said in a statement. Under Tanzanian law, the spy chief serves for a five-year term, which is renewable. Msuya, whose appointment takes immediate effect, was previously head of the anti-corruption agency and was at one time the director of criminal investigations in the police force. Kipilimba will be assigned other duties, the presidency said, without giving details. The move could signal plans by Magufuli to shake up the country’s intelligence service, one security analyst said.
