The company had said on Wednesday it was offering the five sets of notes, the first of which matures in 2022, to fund a range of needs including share repurchases, dividend payments, capital expenditures, acquisitions and repayment of debt. Apple had cash and cash equivalents worth $50.53 billion, as of June 29 as well as tens of billions more in securities holdings. Aggregate net proceeds from the sale will be about $6.96 billion after deducting underwriting discounts and Appleâ€™s offering expense, the company said.
