About 400 aircraft are concerned by the order, which Airbus said should require about one hour per helicopter. The firm said it had issued on Tuesday "an Alert Service Bulletin (ASB) instructing operators to conduct an inspection of the interface between the engine and the main gear box on all recently delivered H125 (AS350 B3e), AS550 and H130 helicopters." A crash of a H125 in the far north of Norway near the town of Alta on August 31 killed six people. "This is a precautionary measure in the light of initial findings by the official investigation," said Airbus Helicopters. "We would emphasise that it does not imply that the root cause of the accident is known," it added. --TheEastAfrican--
