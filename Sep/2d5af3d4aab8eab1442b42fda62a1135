The chiefs, in a joint statement, expressed concerns over the handling of public funds since Mr Weah assumed the presidency last year. This includes $104 million in newly printed local banknotes and $25 million withdrawn from the national reserve for infusion into the economy. The government has yet to account for these. “The country is shaking because the government refuses to clear our doubts over how the monies were used," the elders' statement said. The chiefs told President Weah “efforts and corrective measures being put in place by the government appears not to be having the desired effect.” They also cited concerns from the country’s international partners who have referred to the “worsening situation" in the country. They further hit out at the judiciary, “We don’t need a rocket scientist to tell us we are running into problems", saying "money is running the courtrooms”. President Weah received the statement, promising to read it before giving his official reaction. He however said some of the issues they had raised in their statement appeared to be based “on gossip”. --BBC--
