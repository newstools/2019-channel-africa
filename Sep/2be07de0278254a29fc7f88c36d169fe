Berlin’s support, sealed at a meeting on Tuesday between Chancellor Angela Merkel and IBM Chief Executive Officer, Ginni Rometty, comes as Europe’s biggest economy seeks to catch up to the United States and China in a global technology race. IBM will install a Q System One quantum computer at one of its facilities in Germany, partnering with the Fraunhofer Society, an applied research institute, to build a research unit and community around it. Quantum computers could operate millions of times faster than today’s advanced supercomputers. The technology is based on quantum bits, or qubits, that can be ‘superposed’ on each other, exponentially increasing the amount of information that can be processed. IBM’s current Q System One machine has 20 qubits. “This effort is poised to be a major catalyst for Europe’s innovation landscape and research capabilities,” said Martin Jetter, senior vice president and chairman of IBM Europe.
