"I decided to leave for personal reasons," the 57-year old announced at a press conference in Abidjan on Monday. "I thank the President of the Nigerien Football Federation, Colonel Pele, who has been very kind to me throughout my stay in the country. I will always be grateful to him." Former Ivory Coast coach Zahoui took over Niger in May 2015 and led the home-based side to the 2016 Africa Nations Championship, where they were eliminated at the group stage. He also led them to a third place finish at the West African Football Union Cup in Ghana the following year. Zahoui was in charge of Ivory Coast when they finished as runners-up at the 2012 Africa Cup of Nations finals in Gabon and Equatorial Guinea as they lost to Zambia on penalties. --BBC--
