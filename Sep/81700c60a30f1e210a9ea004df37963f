Zimbabwe was suspended by the International Cricket Council (ICC) in July over a failure to keep the sport free from government interference. The Board of Control for Cricket in India said Sri Lanka would play a three-match series starting January 5 in Guwahati. The second Twenty20 match will be played on January 7 in Indore and the third on January 10 in Pune. Zimbabwe most recently played in the tri-nation Twenty20 tournament in Bangladesh, an event not organised by the ICC.
