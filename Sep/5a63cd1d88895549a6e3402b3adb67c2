On his last day in the country, Francis visited a hospital for HIV-AIDS sufferers run by the Sant’ Egidio community and then said a mass for some 60 000 of people in Maputo’s national stadium. At the hospital and in his homily, Francis spoke of all four of the main themes of the trip to this country as well as Madagascar and Mauritius - peace, poverty, corruption and environmental protection. "Mozambique is a land of abundant natural and cultural riches, yet paradoxically, great numbers of its people live below the poverty level," Francis said in the stadium, in an area of the capital where many people live in shantytowns with houses of corrugated metal roofs. At the AIDS hospital, the pope saw a cross made of wood and shards of metal from the collapsed roof of the home of an elderly woman. According to the UN World Food Programme, 80% of Mozambique’s population of about 30 million cannot afford the minimum costs for an adequate diet.
