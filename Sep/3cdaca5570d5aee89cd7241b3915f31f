The Boks take on the tournament hosts in Kumagaya on Friday in a warm-up match that will be their final match practice ahead of their tournament opener on September 21 contest against the All Blacks in Yokohama. Friday will also see Kolisi back to captain the Boks for the first time since in 2018. A serious knee injury had threatened Kolisi's participation in Japan but he is now back to full fitness, starting a Test for the first time this year and taking back the captaincy. Speaking to media on Thursday, Kolisi acknowledged that it had been difficult not playing for the Boks in 2019, but he said he remained close to the system and the squad throughout his recovery and he was incredibly impressed by what he saw. "I could see how hard the guys were working," Kolisi said. "I have to say, this is a special group and what makes them so special is that they work so hard for one another. "Rather than coming back into a team that was losing all the time, I was coming back into a team that was winning, which was extra pressure. "The support I have had from my team-mates has been amazing. That’s one thing I enjoy about this team - I'm just grateful to be part of it."
