The latest investigation comes on the back of a separate case brought by the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) and one by the Special Presidential Investigation Panel (SPIP). The latest wide-ranging investigation is looking into fraud allegations over how sponsorship money meant for the development of football in the country has been stolen. "What I can confirm is that officials of the Nigeria Football Federation are being investigated by the agency," EFCC Spokesperson, Wilson Uwujaren told BBC Sport. BBC Sport understands that the investigation into the NFF will look at allegations of wrongdoing before the 2014 World Cup in Brazil. The inquiry is focusing on money generated from the NFF's official sponsors, domestic league's television sponsorship and payments from a former kit supplier for all the national teams. It also focus on funds provided by federal and state government for friendly matches involving the Super Eagles and the misappropriation of about $2.7 million from the Financial Assistance Programme of football's world governing body, Fifa. In May, the NFF President Amaju Pinnick told the BBC that he and four other top officials were being "victimised" and denied any wrongdoing over the alleged misappropriation of funds case brought by the SPIP for the recovery of public property. --BBC--
