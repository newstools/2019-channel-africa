Among the 24 men and two women running for election are the prime minister, a media magnate detained last month on suspicion of tax fraud and money laundering, and a candidate from a moderate Islamist party that was banned before the revolution. The presidential election was called early because of the death in July of president Beji Caid Essebsi, the first democratically elected head of state after the popular uprising that overthrew veteran strongman Zine El-Abidine Ben Ali. The president controls foreign and defense policy, governing alongside a prime minister chosen by parliament who has authority over domestic affairs. Whoever ends up leading the country will face the challenge of a faltering economy and continued efforts to plug a large state deficit and public debt. Prime Minister Youssef Chahed told Reuters last week that Tunisia was still under threat from militant groups including Islamic State four years after two attacks killed dozens of tourists, badly hurting Tunisiaâ€™s tourism industry. State television on Monday reported the death of a police chief and three Islamist militants in a security operation near the Algerian border. Meanwhile, unemployment has risen from 12% before the uprising to 15.2% now - rising to 30% in some cities. Despite his continued detention, businessman Nabil Karoui, who owns the private Nesma television station, was kept on the final list of candidates that the electoral commission announced on Saturday. His political party says the charges are politically motivated.
