Former CEO Martin Winterkorn was also charged in the case, according to the indictment filed by Braunschweig prosecutors on Tuesday. The shares fell as much as 2.7% in Frankfurt, the most in almost six weeks. “The company has meticulously investigated this matter with the help of internal and external legal experts for almost four years. The result is clear: the allegations are groundless,” VW’s management board member for legal and integrity Hiltrud Werner said in an emailed statement. “VW remains confident it fulfilled all reporting obligations under capital markets law. “If there is a trial, we are confident that the allegations will prove to be unfounded,” she said. With their top managers now in the firing line, Volkswagen is facing a dramatic setback in the scandal that has been haunting the carmaker since September 2015 when the company admitted that it used software in 11 million diesel vehicles to cheat on emissions tests. The toll at the Wolfsburg, Germany-based Company has reached $33 billion in fines and other expenses so far. The market-manipulation probe was prompted by Germany’s financial regulator Bafin, which in mid-2016 asked prosecutors to investigate Winterkorn and Diess. Three months later, Poetsch was added as a suspect. Diess was chief of the VW brand at the time and had joined the company only in July 2015, just months before the rigging became public. The criminal case may also dim VW’s prospects in a related investor mass suit by shareholders seeking more than 9 billion euros in damages over the same allegations. VW has earmarked $5.8 billion in contingent liabilities for diesel-scandal matters and $3.7 billion are related to the investor lawsuits, Chief Financial Officer Frank Witter told analysts on May 2. At the same time, VW added a $13 billion provision for legal costs. --News24--
