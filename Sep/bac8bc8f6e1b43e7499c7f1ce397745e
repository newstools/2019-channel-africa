SoftBankâ€™s fresh capital for MadeiraMadeira comes from its $5 billion Latin America fund, launched in March, which has been directed to sectors ranging from banking and real estate to home goods and delivery services. Investment firm Light Street Capital is also participating in the funding round, alongside SoftBank and Flybridge Capital, which is already an investor in MadeiraMadeira. The Brazilian retailer, which offers around a million home furnishing products, said it will use the proceeds to invest in technology, logistics and customer services.
