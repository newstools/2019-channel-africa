Pliskova claimed her fourth title of the year as she defeated Petra Martic in a rain-disrupted final in Zhengzhou on Sunday. After the 6-3, 6-2 win, the 27-year-old said that taking top spot from the Australian was "not my goal for now". "My goal is to play well, which I'm trying to play. So that's my goal for now and to enjoy and to (not) really stress about results," she said. There were no other changes in the top 25.
