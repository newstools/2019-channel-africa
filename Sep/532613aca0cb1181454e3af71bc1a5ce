“The Egyptian government expects growth to gradually pick up to 8% by 2022,” he told a meeting of Arab central bank governors. In July, Madbouly said gross domestic product grew 5.6% in the 2018/19 fiscal year. Barring the oil industry, Egypt’s economy has struggled to attract foreign investors since the 2011 uprising that ended Hosni Mubarak’s 30-year rule. Madbouli told the central bank governors that the government wanted to “alter the face of private investment to spur growth.” This includes “continued efforts to improve the business climate, especially by simplifying and lowering the cost of -forming companies and expanding new investment zones,” he said. --Reuters--
