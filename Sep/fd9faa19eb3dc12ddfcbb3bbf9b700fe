But the 24-year-old from Alabama, who won twice on the developmental Korn Ferry Tour last season, looked right at home as he fired nine birdies with just one bogey. "Last night it was tough to sleep," Shelton admitted. "I've been waiting for this moment all season." He capped his round on the Old White TPC in White Sulphur Springs, West Virginia with a birdie at the ninth hole. Shelton was two strokes ahead of defending champion Kevin Na, Scott Harrington, Mark Hubbard, Lanto Griffin and Zack Sucher. Another 10 players were tied at 65, a group that included Chile's Joaquin Niemann and South Korea's Kang Sung. World No 10 Bryson DeChambeau, the highest ranked player in the field, carded a 68 as the PGA Tour's 2019/20 season got underway with the game's top players still resting. The leaderboard featured a host of players who, like Shelton, spent time last season on the developmental Korn Ferry Tour, formerly known as the Web.com tour. But Shelton isn't technically a rookie. He's categorised instead as a "first time member" on the tour because he made eight starts during the 2016/17 season, when he was unable to gain his tour member status. "I think (during) my sponsor exemptions and stuff I thought I had to change my game and try to play with the big boys," he said. "Now, I just know it's golf. (I've) been through the Mackenzie Tour and the Korn Ferry Tour so I know what my game has. "And if I can just get to that a lot sooner, that's the goal."
