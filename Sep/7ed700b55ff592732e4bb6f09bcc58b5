Last week, car dealerships were burnt and over 50 vehicles set alight on Jules street. Reports say a second person has been killed in the Johannesburg Central Business District on Sunday after a splinter group broke away from a crowd that was listening to former Inkatha Freedom Party President, Mangosuthu Buthelezi, who was addressing hostel residents in Jeppestown where he called for calm. Police say 17 people have been arrested.
