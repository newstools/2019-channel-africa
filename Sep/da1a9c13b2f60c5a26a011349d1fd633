Renewable energy project developers will discuss potential solutions ahead of a follow-up engagement with the government on Friday. 

The independent power producers and coal companies met with state officials last week, which resulted in an agreement “to make a contribution to the economic turnaround with a consideration to cost reduction,” the Department of Mineral Resources said by email. The meeting was “very positive” and involved a request around working together to lower electricity prices, Terence Govender, chairperson of the South African Renewable Energy Council, said on Monday. 

The group invited developers and lenders of the first three rounds of projects for South Africa’s program to buy electricity from private renewable producers, for a meeting on Wednesday, he said. 

The utility’s primary energy costs increased by 17%, due to higher coal charges and increased production from independent power producers in its most recent financial year. 

While the renewable IPPs accounted for 4.8% of total production, it made up 22% of total costs, according to an Eskom presentation.
