As the numbers were released, President Donald Trump, whose record as a job creator could wane ahead of next year's elections, renewed his attacks on the US central bank, which he blames for failing to stimulate the economy fast enough. The surprisingly weak result confirmed that labour markets in 2019 have softened from their brisk pace last year amid a protracted trade dispute with China that has dragged down global trade, caused a spike in business uncertainty and driven United States manufacturing into recession. Employers added 130 000 net new positions for the month, far lower than analyst forecasts, while the jobless rate held steady at 3.7% for the third month in a row, and wages rose, according to Labour Department estimates. Estimates for the May and June were also cut by a total of 20 000 positions, bringing the rolling, three-month average to 156 000 positions, well below the 241,000 seen in August 2018. Amid weak investment by companies and mounting fears of a recession, employers also say they are struggling to find qualified workers to fill open positions. The soft jobs numbers should also add to pressure on the Fed to cut interest rates later this month, as economists widely expect it to do. --AFP--
