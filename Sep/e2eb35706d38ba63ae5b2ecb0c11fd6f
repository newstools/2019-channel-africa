The energy index .SPNY fell 1.59% and was the biggest drag on the benchmark S&P 500 index .SPX after sources told Reuters that Saudi Arabia was close to restoring 70% of the oil production lost after weekend attacks on its biggest refinery. The sector recorded its best one-day surge since January on Monday. The US central bank concludes its policy meeting on Wednesday, with traders currently expecting a 65.8% chance of a quarter percentage point cut from the Fed this week, down from 88.8% on Friday, according to CME’s FedWatch. Rate-sensitive bank index .SPXBK was down 1% in anticipation of a reduction in borrowing costs. “It’s just typical trading on the vigil of a Fed meeting,” said Peter Cardillo, chief market economist at Spartan Capital Securities in New York. “We haven’t seen any panic from what happened over the weekend. I think (the Fed) will stick with a quarter of a percentage point cut even after the Saudi attack.”
