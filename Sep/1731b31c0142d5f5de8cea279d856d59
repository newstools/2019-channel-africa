Police spokesperson Colonel Lungelo Dlamini said in a statement that five murders have been reported. 

Most of the deaths were South Africans.

This follows after the President Cyril Ramaphosa issued a statement condemning wave of xenophobic violence unfurling in several parts of South Africa. South African authorities have been struggling to contain a nationwide surge of anti-foreigner sentiment that flared up in Johannesburg on Sunday. Mobs descended on business hubs and townships in various parts of the country, looting dozens of shops and torching trucks driven by foreigners. 
--AFP-- The people of our country want to live in harmony; whatever concerns or grievances we may have, we need to handle them in a democratic way. There can be no justification for any South African to attack people from other countries. pic.twitter.com/StGyNlhV1q
