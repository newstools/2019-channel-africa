Featuring some of the best male and female lifesavers in the world, the competition started in 1999 as a trans-Tasman rivalry between Australia and New Zealand before expanding to include South Africa in a Tri-Nations format. In recent years the competition has grown to included teams from Canada, Germany, France, Great Britain, Spain, Japan and the USA, with every nation encouraged to send an open and a youth/development team to the competition. This year South Africa, Australia and New Zealand will compete with athletes from Japan, Spain and the USA. South Africa has selected strong open and youth teams that will include established stars like beach sprinters and flags specialists Ryle de Morny and Durbanite Mandi Maritz, swimmers Amica de Jager and Travis Misdorp, rescue stalwart Martin Binnedell, ironman stars Alice Edward, board star Anna Notten and ski specialists Josh Fenn, Nick Notten, and Dom Notten, who will captain the open team. Marine SLC stalwart Carmel Billson is a threat to all the ocean events, and with Sasha-Lee Corris-Nordengen will be a formidable rescue unit. ""This event is an excellent example of lifeguards at the peak fitness and sharpness in competition among the best in the world," said Lifesaving South Africa president Dhaya Sewduth.
