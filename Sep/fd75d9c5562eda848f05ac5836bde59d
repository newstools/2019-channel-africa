Katsutoshi Komori, Japan’s ambassador to Kenya, told a news conference that a loan of about $450 million will go toward building a 1.3 km bridge linking Mombasa’s mainland to an island in the city. “It is expected that the Mombasa Gate Bridge will reduce the economic losses caused by traffic congestion and allow Mombasa to achieve its full economic potential,” he said. Another $350 million loan and a $57 million grant will go toward developing a port, road, electricity and water supply and drainage in the special economic zone known as Dongo Kundu in Mombasa. Japan is looking to boost its investment in Africa, much as its rival China has been doing for years. At a conference in Tokyo last month attended by a few dozen African leaders, Prime Minister Shinzo Abe said Japan would expand its private-sector investment in Africa, which came to $20 billion over the past three years. The port city of Mombasa is a gateway to east and central Africa. It processes imports and exports for Kenya and several other countries including Uganda, Rwanda, Democratic Republic of Congo, South Sudan and Burundi. Ferries between the mainland and island in the city carry about 300 000 people a day, and they are usually congested with both human and vehicle traffic.
