Kick-off is at 19:00. Masandawana were at their ruthless best as they romped to a 5-0 victory over Cote d'Or in the first leg of their qualifying first-round tie, meaning they already have one foot in the group stages of the continental competition. But, despite being firmly in the driver's seat heading into the return leg, Mosimane wants his charges to chase the goals in Pretoria in a bid to bolster their confidence levels ahead of Wednesday's trip to Black Leopards. When asked if he would field a strong line-up for Friday's clash, Mosimane hinted at naming an unchanged squad. "Probably, I'll play the same team as I had against Maritzburg United (last Saturday) and let them go out and score goals," Mosimane was quoted as saying by Times Live. "Let's move the ball. I'll tell you why I need the goals, I need the team to score goals, I need the confidence. "Look at where we are right now, we are not really the team that we always are. We need the confidence, the goals." The first round of fixtures in the group stages of the CAF Champions League are scheduled to take place between 29 November and 1 December. If, as expected, Downs do progress to the group phase, they can expect a long and gruelling campaign, with the quarter-finals pencilled in for the first two weeks of April 2020.
