The group's profits declined to R41.22 million ($2.80 million), down from R45 million ($3.06 million) compared to last year. The minimum wage legislation hurt Workforce’s staffing and outsourcing business, with the unit reporting a 15% decline in earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (Ebitda) to R65 million ($4.42 million). 

Workforce Holdings is a holding company which has four core business segments that include staffing and outsourcing, training, financial services and healthcare. South Africa’s subdued economic climate, the election effect and a general contraction in government spend on infrastructure also affected the group’s overall performance, it said. The group reported a decline of 6.1% decline in earnings per share to 18.5 cents a share, however, Ebitda rose 5.2% to R80 million($5.44 million). The decline in staffing and outsourcing was offset by an increase in the training segment as it reported a 42% increase in Ebitda to R27.3 million($1.86 million), with the Dyna Group, its latest acquisition, contributing R2.8 million ($190 000) in Ebitda. Chief Executive Ronny Katz said the group was encouraged by the training segment's performance. “We are quite happy with our overall performance despite the decline in the staffing and outsourcing business,” Katz said. The healthcare segment also reported a strong growth with Ebitda increasing by 54% to R15.9 million ($1.08 million), benefiting from investments made during the period. The group's revenue increased by 7.7% to R1.53 billion ($100 million), up from R1.42 billion ($97 000), while cash generated from operations increased by 28.5% to R48.5 million ($3.30 million), up from R37.7 million ($2.56 million) compared to last year. Looking ahead, Katz said the outlook for the South African economy remained constrained. Workforce's share price gained 14.29% to close at R1.60 on the JSE on Monday.
