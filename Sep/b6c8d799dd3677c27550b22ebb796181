Police say DNA tests carried out on the remains of four bodies found in a cesspit in the city of Takoradi in August have confirmed that they are those of the missing girls. They disappeared between August and December 2018 and three people have been arrested in connection with the case. People on social media are angry with the Criminal Investigation Department (CID) boss as she told the media in April that the girls were alive and that officers were working hard to return them to their homes safely. Tiwaa Addo-Danquah has subsequently explained that she made the comments as she “wanted to give the families hope”. The hashtags #BringBackOurTaadiGirls and #TwiaaMustGo are trending on Twitter with people criticising the police for their handling of the investigation. The girls' families are now calling for independent DNA tests to be carried out on the bodies to confirm their identity because they do not trust the police. --BBC--
