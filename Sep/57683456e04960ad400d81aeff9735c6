Four months on from his international debut, Archer has already played a starring role in England's historic World Cup win, leading the team's wicket charts and bowling the decisive super over in the Lord's final, and excelled in the pressure cooker of the Ashes. He picked up 22 Australian wickets in just four Test matches at an average of 20.27 and was responsible for some hair-raising spells of fast bowling. The 24-year-old drew a blank on his final day of the series, when England’s 135-run win at The Oval squared the score at 2-2, but his fiery battle with centurion Matthew Wade was arguably the highlight of the contest. Not for the first time in his short Test career Archer cranked the speed gun and whipped the crowd into a frenzy as he peppered the batsmen with short balls. He is a box office talent and one that leaves Root battling conflicting instincts: as a cricket lover he is plainly enthused, as a skipper he is understandably protective. "When I faced him in the nets against the red ball it was pretty clear he'd be something special," Root said. "He's come in and been fantastic. He has a way of having a huge impact on the game. His spell here, you saw the way he changed the whole atmosphere at the ground. "For someone right at the beginning their career to have such a gift, it’s great to be able to captain that and I very much look forward to rest of his journey.
