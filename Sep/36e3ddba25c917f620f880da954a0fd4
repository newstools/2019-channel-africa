Huawei’s top salesman Richard Yu showcased the Mate 30 Pro and Mate 30 phones at a glitzy event in Munich, Germany, its first unveiling of an all-new phone since President Donald Trump hit the Chinese company with an export ban in May.. “It’s got a large screen but it’s very compact in your hand,” Yu, head of Huawei’s consumer business, said of the phone, whose fate in Europe will hang on whether customers buy a device lacking access to software and apps supported by Google. “Despite all the concerns surrounding Huawei, and the challenges it faces, it remains defiant and prepared to soldier on,” said telecoms and media analyst Paolo Pescatore. Washington has effectively banned US firms from supplying Huawei, alleging it is a national security risk as its equipment could be used by Beijing to spy, something which Huawei has repeatedly denied. The number two smartphone maker expects the US ban to cost it $10 billion.
