The energy firm, which supplies about 95% of the country’s power, has about R440bn in debt and is surviving on state bailouts after massive cost overruns at two partially completed coal-fired plants. While the government has proposed splitting it into three units and a policy paper by the National Treasury proposes selling coal-fired power plants, no strategy to stabilise its finances has been published yet. "For us, there will be only one plan and that will be the one that both the government and the company agreed to," Lucie Villa, Moody’s vice president and lead sovereign analyst for South Africa, said in an interview in Johannesburg on Monday. "Knowing the complexity of the issue, we know first that it will be an iterative process and that it takes time. So our view has been that is takes more than a few months to sort out certain issues." Moody's on Monday published a research report on the impact of load shedding on SA's municipalities and metropolitan areas. The report does not constitute a ratings action. Moody’s is the only major ratings company that still assesses South Africa’s debt at investment grade. While it has a stable outlook on the Baa3 rating, one level above junk, analysts are speculating that it’s at risk of a downgrade given weak economic growth and rising debt. A downgrade would leave South Africa without any investment-grade credit rating for the first time in 25 years. It would also see the country fall out of key bond indexes including the FTSE World Government Bond Index prompting outflows. --News24--
