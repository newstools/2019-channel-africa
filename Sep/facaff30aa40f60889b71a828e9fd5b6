The Sunday accident happened mid-stream at the busy Mombasa-Likoni crossing. A video posted on Twitter captured the incident. An eyewitness told the Daily Nation newspaper that a woman and a boy were in the vehicle: â€œI saw the woman and a boy inside the car. She had started screaming and calling for help when the car started to reverse. I threw a life saver at them." Authorities at Kenya Ferry Services say search and rescue operations are under way.
