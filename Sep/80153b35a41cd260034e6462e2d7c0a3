SABC Sport has learnt from its sources in Zambia that the xenophobic attacks that have engulfed Gauteng in the past few days have put pressure on the Zambia Football Association (FAZ) to reconsider the game between Chipolopolo and Bafana Bafana at Heroes Stadium on Saturday. This would be for the first time that football is a victim of the attack on foreign nationals and it’s feared that this could lead to further diplomatic fallout in the Southern African region. Bafana Bafana are camping in Johannesburg under the new coach Molefi Ntseki and all the overseas-based players have arrived in camp. 

SAFA is not available for comment as it is also believed that they are trying to find a replacement opponent.
