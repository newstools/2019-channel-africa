Risk assets took a hit in US trade on Friday following news that President Donald Trump’s administration is considering radical new financial pressure tactics on Beijing, including the possibility of delisting Chinese companies from U.S. stock exchanges. “The pressure on emerging markets is mounting, as the US continues to make waves in the global market,” Bianca Botes, Treasury Partner at Peregrine Treasury Solutions, said in a note. “Washington announced over the weekend that the US was investigating ways to limit its portfolio investment flows to China, although the US Treasury subsequently denied plans to block Chinese listings on US stock exchanges.” On the data front, British economic growth and US manufacturing indicators are due later on Monday, with U.S. employment figures set to be released at the end of the week. Locally, markets will look to August trade balance numbers due at 1200 GMT. In fixed income, the yield on the benchmark government bond due in 2026 added 4 basis points to 8.335%, reflecting weaker bond prices. --Reuters--
