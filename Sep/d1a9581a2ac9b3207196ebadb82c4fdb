Apple Inc (AAPL.O) rose 1.3% as Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook told a German daily, Bild, that iPhone sales were off to a strong start, and JP Morgan raised its iPhone shipment volume forecast. Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) climbed 0.4%. The technology sector .SPLRCT gained 0.6%, the most among 11 major S&P sectors. Only energy stocks .SPNY were in the red, tracking a drop in oil prices. Still, the main indexes were on course to end the quarter with their worst performance so far in 2019, with sentiment swinging wildly due to developments in the US-China trade war and mixed indications from domestic economic data. Reports about the United States curbing Chinese companies' access to US capital markets sparked a sell-off on Friday, with the S&P 500 .SPX and Nasdaq .IXIC hitting a more than three-week low during the session. However, on Monday, White House trade adviser Peter Navarro dismissed the reports as “fake news.” “If the US goes down this road, it could have some serious repercussions,” said Robert Pavlik, chief investment strategist at SlateStone Wealth LLC in New York.
