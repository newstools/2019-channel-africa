Headline earnings per share were up 9.8% to 1,352.1 cents and the company said exceptional cost and capital discipline as well as improved margins were highlights against a volatile trading backdrop. "There has been a strong focus on our clients, on solutions, innovation, wholesaling the right product at the appropriate price point as well as bolt-on acquisitions in the services and office & print divisions, which has culminated in acceptable growth," Chief Executive Officer, Lindsay Ralphs, said. The group declared a final cash dividend of 318 cents per share, bringing the total dividend for the year to 600 cents, up 7.9% from last year. Strong profitability gains were achieved at Adcock Ingram while Comair recognised the successful claim awarded against South African Airways, which increased Bidvestâ€™s share of profits from these associated companies. Bidvest said its diverse portfolio of businesses and extensive reach allowed it to weather challenging times. "Our basic-need services and everyday essential product ranges enable us to support and add value to all our stakeholders. Innovation to disrupt ourselves, and the industries in which we operate, remains a core focus alongside disciplined asset management and cost control," Ralphs said. --ANA--
