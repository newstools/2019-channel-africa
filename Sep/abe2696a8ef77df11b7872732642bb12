Kyrgios wracked up record fines for his on-court antics in Cincinnati, which included smashing rackets and abusing umpires. A decision is reportedly yet to be made on whether a suspension will follow, but fellow Australian Rafter has already had his say. "I don't understand why it hasn't happened," he said during the launch of the ATP Cup in Sydney earlier this week. "There is obviously something else going on behind the scenes. I don't know. "On paper it looks like he should be suspended, to me. But at what stage do you say the crowd is more important? Or are you trying to uphold a certain standard or protocol for players to adhere to." Kyrgios took to Twitter to defend his contribution that he makes to the Tour as well as questioning Rafter's patriotism.
