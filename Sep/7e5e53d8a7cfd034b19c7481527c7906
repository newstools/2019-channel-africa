Mugabe's nephew Patrick Zhuwao said this during a memorial service hosted by the Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) in Orlando East, Soweto, on Thursday. Zhuwao said Mugabe, who died in Singapore last week, had given specific instructions to his wife and children on how and where he should be buried. He said he had spoken to Mugabe's children, who had instructed him to issue a statement. "We are being coerced by Mnangagwa to ignore Mugabe's wishes on where his remains should be interred." The family of Mugabe and Zimbabwe's government have been at odds over whether he would be buried at his homestead in Kutama, northwest of Harare, or at the National Heroes Acre in the capital. "When Mugabe was deposed, some of the comrades that are now wanting to stand and pontificate over his funeral refused to acknowledge him. They tormented him, they made him suffer and the family decided that we could no longer allow him to watch the news. "Why do they want to pontificate over him when they did not want him in Zanu-PF? He is wanted here in the EFF," Zhuwoa said. Mugabe, whose rule ended in a military coup in 2017, died last week at the age of 95. His body was flown back from Singapore on Wednesday.
