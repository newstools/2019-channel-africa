The scales being stored with elephant tusks in the fetid container are part of a growing haul of pangolin cargos seized in Nigeria, a country that is now the main hub for gangs sending African pangolins to Asia, according to law enforcement officials, non-governmental organisations and wildlife experts. They say porous borders, lax law enforcement, corruption and one of the continent’s biggest ports have helped criminal networks in Nigeria corner most of the African trade in pangolins, considered to be the world’s most trafficked mammal. Ranging in size from a small rabbit to a large dog depending on the species, pangolins are the only mammals with scales. 

The nocturnal tree-climbers that feed on ants and termites are more closely related to bears than the anteaters they resemble. In 2019 alone, Hong Kong and Singapore have intercepted three huge shipments of pangolin scales weighing a combined 33.9 tonnes and worth more than $100 million, based on estimates of their value in Singapore. Each shipment was bigger than any that had come from Africa before in and they all came from Nigeria.   
 
According to wildlife trade watchdog TRAFFIC, less than a quarter of major pangolin seizures from Africa came via Nigeria in 2016.
