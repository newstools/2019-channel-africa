The United States and more than 50 other countries recognise Guaido, the leader of the opposition-controlled National Assembly, as the rightful president. Guaido in January invoked the constitution to assume a rival presidency to Maduro, arguing the socialist president’s May 2018 re-election was a sham. But the 193-member UN General Assembly still recognises Maduro, who retains the support of the UN Security Council’s veto-wielding permanent members Russia and China, setting the stage for the two sides to air their public grievances as they battle for international backing. A round of negotiations brokered by Norway in recent months, aimed at peacefully resolving the crisis, has failed. Guaido is seeking to get more countries, especially the European Union, to implement sanctions on Venezuela, as the US has done. Maduro, who has overseen a collapse of the OPEC nation’s once-prosperous economy and has been accused by the UN’s High Commissioner for Human Rights of rights violations, wants to heap pressure on the US to lift sanctions on state oil company PDVSA and members of his inner circle. Critics say his government’s decisions this week to free a jailed opposition lawmaker and reform Venezuela’s electoral body, long accused of bias, were aimed at improving Maduro’s image before the UN gathering. “They want to use the UN meeting to wash their face because they are not reaching any real solutions for the Venezuelan people,” Carlos Valero, an opposition lawmaker who sits on the National Assembly’s foreign affairs committee, said in an interview on Wednesday. Maduro calls Guaido a US puppet seeking to oust him in a coup and blames Washington’s sanctions for Venezuela’s economic woes. 

Maduro himself said he will not attend the UN gathering, but he tasked two cabinet members with presenting a petition condemning the sanctions to Secretary General Antonio Guterres.
