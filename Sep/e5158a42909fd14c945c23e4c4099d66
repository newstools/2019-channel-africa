This comes hours after the High Court ordered the police to allow Peter Magombeyi to leave the country. Rights activists and local media are reporting that police are currently blocking him from leaving a medical facility in the capital Harare: Earlier this month Dr Magombeyi's colleagues said he was abducted by state agents after he had organised a health workers' strike. Five days later he was found alive but extremely disoriented. His apparent abduction was the latest in a series of disappearances of government critics - some of whom have been tortured. In a tweet, a prominent opposition politician accused the police of trying to block Dr Magombeyi because South African doctors may report that he had been tortured and this had caused him to suffer from memory loss. --BBC--
