Venezuela has suffered a severe economic and political crisis over the past several years, including wide-spread shortages of basic goods and soaring inflation, which has also caused debts owed to the airlines to pile up. Due in large part to strict currency controls in place since 2003, the government of President Nicolas Maduro has for years failed to reimburse the airlines in hard currency for ticket sales in local currency. "Right now, recovering this money is a lost cause," said Peter Cerda, IATA’s regional vice president for the Americas, on the sidelines of the Aviation Day industry forum held in Panama City. "We hope that in the future, when there’s a change of administration, it allows us to have a dialogue about recovering that money," he added. Cerda added that IATA, which represents some 240 airline companies, has not had any talks with Maduro’s government in two years.
