The result means the country will go through to the next qualification stage of the 2022 World Cup. Zimbabwe scored in the 77th minute to level the tie, but Somalia replied with a goal just seven minutes later. With the score at 2-1 on aggregate it looked like Somalia's Ocean Stars, the joint-lowest ranked side in Africa, were heading for a shock victory. But Zimbabwe's Khama Billiat, who missed the first-leg, scored in the 92nd minute to send his country through. --BBC--
