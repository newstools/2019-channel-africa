Garner, 28, who hails from Somerset West, caused something of an upset when she edged world No 1 and three-time world champion, Phillis Meti of New Zealand, by just three yards in the final at the WinStar World Casino and Resort in Oklahoma. Garner longest effort in the final measured 347 yards (317 metres). "That was unbelievable,"said Garner. "I felt really good going into it. I felt like I had found a good rhythm. I think maybe Phillis felt a bit more pressure having to back up those titles, whereas I was able to let loose." Kyle Berkshire won the men's title, while Jeff Crittenden picked up the Masters title. "Being a World Champion I've dreamed since being a child" Garner is going to remember this week for a long, long time. #WorldLongDrive.
