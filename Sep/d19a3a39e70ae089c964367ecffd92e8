Nigeria's government has been outspoken in its condemnation of the violence. South Africa's foreign minister called it an embarrassment for her country. "Our government regrets all violence against foreign-owned stores or Africans from other countries who are resident in South Africa," national broadcaster SABC quotes the minister, Naledi Pandor, as saying. She had ordered the closure of the country's high commission in the Nigerian capital, Abuja, and its mission in Lagos, following threats made to the diplomatic staff, Ms Pandor told the Reuters news agency. On Tuesday and Wednesday, South African-owned businesses were targeted by protesters in several Nigerian cities. South African telecoms giant MTN closed its shops as a precaution. Seven people have been killed in the trouble in South Africa but none of the victims have been identified as Nigerian. Nevertheless, videos and images being shared on social media purporting to show Nigerians being attacked and killed have inflamed tensions. Nigerian President Muhammadu Buhari has sent an envoy to South Africa to "express Nigeria's displeasure over the treatment of her citizens".
