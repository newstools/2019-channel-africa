The violent clashes began at the Moria refugee camp on Sunday after a fire broke out inside a shipping container, one of the means Greek authorities use to house refugees. At least 17 people were hurt. The migrant camp, the country’s biggest, is operating at almost four times its capacity. The charred remains of a woman were taken to hospital, the health ministry said in a statement. Reports of a second victim remained unconfirmed, officials said, adding that the cause of the fire was under investigation. Deputy Citizen Protection Minister Lefteris Economou told reporters that 250 people would be transferred from Moria to the mainland by the end of Monday. The issue would be discussed during a cabinet meeting chaired by the prime minister, a government official said. About 12 000 migrants and refugees are holed up in Moria camp, a collection of tents and shipping containers, according to data released by the UNHCR, the UN refugee agency. 

The government aims to move at least 3 000 people from its islands to the mainland by the end of October, the official said.
