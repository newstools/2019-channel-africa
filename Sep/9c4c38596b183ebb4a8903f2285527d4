The minute of silence was observed at 1453 local time (1253 GMT) on the grid before the race gets underway at 1510, according to an official schedule. A video paying tribute to the Frenchman also played on screens around the circuit. The supporting Formula Three series, which shares the same paddock with Formula Two, also held a minute’s silence before the start of its second race on Sunday. The crash that killed Hubert took place on the second lap of the race on Saturday. He had already gone off into the barriers when Juan Manuel Correa, unable to avoid the Frenchman, collided with his car at high speed at the exit of the Spa-Francorchamps track’s fast Raidillon corner. Correa, who suffered fractures to both his legs and a minor spinal injury, has had surgery and is resting in intensive care. Saturday’s Formula Two race was initially suspended before being abandoned. --Reuters--
