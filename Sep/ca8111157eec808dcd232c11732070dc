"I call on all Zambians both locally and abroad to remain calm and disengage from acts of violence as they voice out their grievance. Let us continue praying for peace and unity across the region." On Wednesday morning, in Zambia's capital, Lusaka, people protesting against the attacks raided a South African-owned supermarket. The country's football association, Faz, has cancelled a friendly match against south Africa scheduled to take place on Saturday as a protest over the violence. --BBC--
