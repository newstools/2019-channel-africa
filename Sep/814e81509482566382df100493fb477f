Outside directors Jenifer Rogers and Keiko Ihara, members of corporate governance committees created in the aftermath of the arrest of former chairman Carlos Ghosn, pushed for Saikawa’s departure at a board meeting that went on for several hours at Nissan Motor’s (7201.T) Yokohama headquarters, the sources said. Ihara, a Japanese racing driver, and Rogers, an American lawyer, also lobbied to install Saikawa’s right-hand man, Yasuhiro Yamauchi, as interim CEO until a successor was found, the two sources with knowledge of the meeting said. The intervention suggests that even as the automaker was wrestling with its worst crisis since Ghosn’s dramatic fall from grace, it took pressure from company outsiders to oust his former protege. Nissan said on Monday that Saikawa will resign on Sept. 16, after he admitted to being improperly overpaid by $440,000. The stand taken by Ihara and Rogers, the only women on Nissan’s board, is also a rare example of the influence of foreigners and women in Japanese boardrooms, which was almost unheard of a few decades ago. Nissan declined to comment. “To improve Nissan’s relationship with its dealers, suppliers and customers, Rogers argued that Saikawa had to leave,” said one of the sources, who declined to be identified because the information has not been made public.
