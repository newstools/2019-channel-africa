Benjamin Ndimila, the Chief Executive Officer of Tanzania Government Flight Agency (TGFA), told Reuters that under the contract Airbus (AIR.PA) would supply two A220-300 aircraft. President John Magufuli has been personally championing the revival of Air Tanzania Company Limited (ATCL), joining other regional governments that are launching or revamping national carriers to share in Africa’s growing aviation business. Last month, neighboring Uganda also relaunched its national carrier. TGFA, under the president’s office, leases aircraft to Air Tanzania. Air Tanzania’s existing fleet includes one Boeing (BA.N) 787-8 Dreamliner, two Airbus A220-300 jets and three DHC Dash 8-400 aircraft, formerly known as the Bombardier Q400 turboprop. Ndimila said the new Airbus planes would have a more luxurious interior than in the existing aircraft. “The new planes will have an improved entertainment system including screens in each seat,” he said.
