This is after parliament increased the excise tax on cigarettes, wines and spirits by 5.15 percentage points from the original proposal of 15% in the Finance Bill 2019. The Bill is now awaiting presidential assent. Manufacturers now say they will pass on the additional costs to consumers, a move they reckon could push millions of consumers to resort into consuming illicit products, which could pose significant social costs to the country. In a joint statement on Thursday, cigarette and alcoholic beverage manufacturers termed the move by Parliament’s Departmental Committee on Finance and National Planning as “strange and unusual.” “The further proposed tax increase ultimately widens the existing disparity in excise and prices across the East Africa Community countries, increasing profit margins for illicit traders and in turn increasing the supply and availability of illicit products,” said the statement. The statement was signed by Alcoholic Beverages Association of Kenya, Mastermind Tobacco and British American Tobacco. Kenya hopes the increased sin tax will net more revenue to help bring down the budget deficit that stands at 5.7% this financial year. The increase comes amid concerns of a rise in the illicit trade in cigarettes. --TheEastAfrican--
