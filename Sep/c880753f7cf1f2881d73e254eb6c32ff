The attack on the world’s biggest oil exporter sent oil prices up as much as 20% before they eased off their peaks as US President Donald Trump authorized the use of the country’s emergency oil stockpile to ensure stable supplies. [O/R] The S&P 500 Energy .SPNY, one of the worst performing sectors this year, soared 3.18%, its best day since Janaury 4. At least 14 of the top advancers on the S&P 500 were energy stocks. Shares of Marathon Oil Corp MRO.O and Devon Energy Corp (DVN.N) rose more than 8% each and led the gains. The supply disruptions should put a bid into US energy stocks, which have meaningfully lagged the broader market, JPM analysts wrote in a note. “In particular, we could see a positive move in the oily small and mid-cap group.” Meanwhile, anticipation of higher fuel costs drove down shares of airlines and cruise line operators. American Airlines Group Inc (AAL.O), Delta Air Lines Inc (DAL.N) and Carnival Corp (CCL.N) fell between 2% and 5%.
