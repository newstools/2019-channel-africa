After a roller-coaster week dominated by United Kingdom and Italian political drama, Washington and Beijing trade talk, global monetary stimulus and Argentina’s imposing capital controls, calm looked to have returned. Then Beijing cut in. As Chinese markets were closing, the country’s central bank said it was slashing the amount of cash that banks must hold as reserves for the third time in 2019. 

That released a total of $126.35 billion to shore up the slowing economy. Europe’s pan-region Stoxx 600, London FTSE, Paris CAC 40 and DAX in Frankfurt were all higher, after rising to their highest in more than month on Thursday. Euro zone bond yields steadied after their worst one-day selloff in more than a year. The euro and pound saw weekly gains after the biggest drop for the dollar in a month. "It feels to me like the air is coming out of it a bit," Societe Generale strategist Kit Juckes said, referring to the recent surge in volatility. "So we will see what we get from the payrolls." The closely watched United States non-farm payrolls report due at 1230 GMT was expected to show 158,000 jobs were added in August and the unemployment rate was unchanged at 3.7%. Surveys on Thursday had suggested the US may be in better shape than investors have been fearing. Services activity accelerated in August and private employers increased hiring more than expected.
