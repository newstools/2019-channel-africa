Lands, housing and human settlements development minister William Lukuvi said the sisal plantations were located at Mkomazi in the coastal region of Tanga. “The investor has failed to meet conditions for the development of the plantations, including failure to pay due taxes,” said Lukuvi on a visit to the Mkinga district in Tanga region, where the farms are located.

The minister told a public rally in the Mayomboni area that the investor had abandoned the plantations, breaching conditions given to him when he acquired the farms. He said ownership of the farms to the private investor had been revoked after president John Magufuli had assented to a request by the lands ministry to repossess the farms.

Lukuvi said the farms will be allocated to 16 450 villagers from 10 villages living within the plantations for the construction of schools, housing and farming. In August 2017, Magufuli ordered repossession of all farms that have remained idle for a long time.

Speaking at public meetings in the Tanga region, the head of state said once the farms were repossessed, they will be distributed to people for their own use.

According to Key Colours, sisal is used for cordage, twine and rope. It is also used in creating macramé, wire rope core, handicrafts, carpets, mattresses, geotextiles, filters, buffing cloths, dartboards and specialised paper. In order to replace fiberglass and asbestos, sisal too has been used as an eco-friendly agent.
