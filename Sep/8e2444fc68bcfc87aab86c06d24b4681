Led by Dereje Negash, an Orthodox Christian priest who has spent more than a decade warning about the spread of homosexuality in Ethiopia, the leaders intend to introduce the association at an event in the capital, Addis Ababa, on Sunday. It is part of a broader effort to pressure the government of Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed to take a harder line against sexual minorities. "The reason we're holding this event now is because the problem is escalating. Homosexuality is affecting a lot of children and expanding," Dereje told AFP. "Our goal is not to attack and destroy homosexuals, but to teach them and lead them to the truth." Conversion therapy, also known as reparative therapy, has been broadly denounced as pseudoscientific and ineffective. But it is widely practised in parts of Africa, often fuelled by religion and "family and cultural pressures", according to a report released in August by OutRight Action International, an LGBTI human rights organisation based in New York. The report provided little information specific to Ethiopia, though it noted that forms of conversion therapy elsewhere on the continent include beatings and "exorcisms". Dereje told AFP he had successfully used his own form of conversion therapy, which involves fasting and visits to Ethiopian monasteries -- to compel scores of people to abandon same-sex sexual acts. --AFP--
