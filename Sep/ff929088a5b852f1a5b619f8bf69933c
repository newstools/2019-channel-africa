With the advent of the internet consumers now have more options, a luxury that big travel operators have found difficult adapting to as the collapse of Thomas Cook shows. A departure in the middle of the week, leaving from one airport and returning to another, extending a business trip into a mini-vacation, these are now common practices. Thanks to being able to book airline tickets online and apps that offer a plethora of lodging options like Airbnb and Booking.com. The emergence of these firms means that consumers can, and are, bypassing travel agents and tour operators. "The younger generation are organising their travel for themselves more and more and the people who travel in a more classical way are also searching for a more personalised experience," said Jean-Pierre Mas, head of the trade association for French travel agencies. "We need to offer some flexibility," he added. Some industry giants like 178-year old Thomas Cook couldn't adjust to the "shift towards a tourism more about identity and affinity," said Didier Arino, head of the Protourisme consultancy. The travel agencies that are still in the game understood the need to specialise, he added. "Thomas Cook failed because it didn't move with the times," said Markets.com analyst Neil Wilson, citing its inability to embrace the web. The collapse of Thomas Cook has left millions of travellers stranded across the world. Britain started repartriation of an estimated 150 000 travellers on Monday with the first batch of about 15 000 arriving in London on Tuesday. Europe is facing a more daunting predicament with more than 600 000 of its nationals at various destinations across the world. --TheEastAfrican--
