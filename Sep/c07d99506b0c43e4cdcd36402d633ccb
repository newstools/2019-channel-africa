The regulator said Monday that the activities of the Nairobi-based firm going by the names WIE Limited or Women Investing in Entrepreneurship (WIIE) are not authorised. CMA said an undisclosed amount of money has already been raised from 279 unnamed women. “The Authority’s preliminary investigations revealed that WIE Limited has been raising money from the public through a public offer of shares targeting women as their customers and also branding itself as a women’s income and wealth incubator,” said CMA Chief Executive Officer, Paul Muthaura in a statement. “WIIE Limited business model furthermore seems to have been endorsed by various women celebrities in the country in a bid to lure more women investors.” He added that CMA in collaboration with other law enforcement agencies has frozen the company’s bank account pending further inquiries, noting that the nature and features of the capital raising by WIE is taking the form of a regulated activity, which has, however not been approved by the regulator. --Daily Monitor--
