Frustrated conservationists hope Friday’s arrival of the environmentally-conscious Pope Francis will spotlight the island that lost 2% of primary rainforest in 2018, the highest of any tropical nation according to the World Resources Institute. "He should say that this forest is God’s creation. He gave it to us and for our own benefit," said Anselme Toto Volahy, researcher from Durrell Wildlife Conservation Trust. "If we don’t manage it well, we will destroy ourselves." The Kirindy forest, on the west of the island, spans 100 000 hectares but has lost almost half its size in two decades. Wastelands of blackened stumps are broken only by scorched trunks and twisted boughs of baobab trees resistant to fires. Kirindy is home to a multitude of rare species, including the tiny Madame Berthe’s mouse lemur, the world’s smallest primate, which only exists there. 

Bug-eyed and weighing just 35 grams, the lemur’s habitat may be completely destroyed in three years, said Volahy, though the animal might go sooner. Matthias Markolf, a lemur specialist at the German Primate Centre in Kirindy, has not spotted it for two years.
