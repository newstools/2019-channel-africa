Zainab Ahmed, addressing journalists late on Wednesday after a cabinet meeting, said the government proposed raising VAT in 2020 to 7.2% - up from 5%. The current level is one of the lowest in the world. The planned rise must be approved by parliament before it can become law. President Muhammadu Buhari's government has repeatedly said it wants to boost non-oil revenues since oil sales make up 90%of foreign exchange receipts. Raising more money from taxes has proved difficult in a country where so many small businesses are not registered. Ahmed said the cabinet approved the proposed VAT rise when it met on Wednesday. "This is important because the federal government only retains 15% of the VAT, 85% is actually for the states and local government. The states need additional revenue to be able to meet the obligations of the minimum wage," she said. Nigeria's minimum wage was increased in April to $98 a month from 18,000. Prior to the minimum wage rise the government had argued that many of Nigeria's 36 states struggled to pay salaries of state employees.Â 

The proposed VAT hike is part of a broader drive to increase tax revenues.
