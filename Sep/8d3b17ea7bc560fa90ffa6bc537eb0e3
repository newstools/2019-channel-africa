Lucara’s find comes just three days after London-listed Petra Diamonds Ltd said it recovered an extremely rare 20.08 carat blue diamond from its flagship Cullinan mine in South Africa, the world’s main source of blue diamonds. Blue diamonds comprise only about 0.02% of mined diamonds and are highly sought after for their colour and rarity. Lucara earlier this year unearthed the largest uncut diamond, 1.758-carat and weighing close to 352 grams, in recent history from the Botswana mine. The company also said on Thursday it had found a 4.13 carat pink gem diamond. --Reuters--
