Their experiment is the first outside the lab to release genetically altered mosquitoes in the hope of reducing their ability to spread the often deadly disease. It works using a technique called a gene drive, which edits and then propagates a gene in a population - in this case to prevent males from producing offspring. Investments in anti-malarial drugs, mosquito nets and insecticides have slowed malaria over the past two decades in Africa, which accounts for more than 90% of global cases. But malaria still killed more than 400 000 people across the continent in 2017, and the World Health Organization says progress against the disease is stalling, leading researchers to push for fresh approaches. “The conventional tools that we have at our disposal today have reached their limit,” said Dr Abdoulaye Diabate, who is running the experiment for Target Malaria, a research consortium backed by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation. One hot evening in July, Diabate’s researchers peeled off mesh nettings from wire-rimmed containers to release about 5000 male mosquitoes into Souroukoudinga, a village in western Burkina Faso. The mosquitoes had been injected as embryos with an enzyme that sterilizes them. “Our objective is not to eradicate mosquitoes,” said Diabate, noting the enzyme targets only the three main species - out of more than 3 500 worldwide - that carry malaria. “The objective is to reduce the density of these mosquitoes.” Target Malaria is also developing an enzyme preventing male mosquitoes from passing on X chromosomes. This results in male offspring, reducing malaria since only female mosquitoes bite - males mostly feed off plant honeydew. Diabate said he hoped the new approaches would win approval from national regulators in the coming years for widespread use.
