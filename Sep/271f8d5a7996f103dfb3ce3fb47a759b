GPI, which runs the Burger King chain of fast-food restaurants in South Africa and operates casinos, had reported a loss last year after its struggling units, Dunkin’ Donuts and ice-cream business Baskin-Robbins, dented the company’s earnings. The closure of both units, announced earlier this year after GPI failed to find a buyer, helped lift the investment company’s headline earnings per share (HEPS). The company’s HEPS, the main profit measure in South Africa that strips out certain one-off items, came in at 8.91 cents per share compared with a headline loss of 11.18 cents per share last year. “We have made excellent progress in improving the overall profitability of the business, and this will continue to be a strong focus, along with driving new restaurant growth in Burger King,” Chief Executive Officer, Mohsin Tajbhai, said in a statement. In 2016, GPI signed a franchise agreement with Dunkin’ Brands Group, which owns Dunkin’ Donuts and Baskin-Robbins, betting that South African demand for snacks and drinks from international chains would hold up, despite pressures on disposable income. However, retailers have been struggling to boost sales as a slowing economy, high unemployment rate and rising fuel costs reduced consumers’ spending power. The liquidation of Dunkin’ Donuts unit saw Grand Parade’s headline loss narrow to R25.1 million ($1.70 million) from R36.6 million ($2.4 million) last year, while Baskin-Robbins’ loss reduced to R11.5 million ($778 314) from R24.9 million ($1.6 million) in the year-ago period. GPI said the company is planning to focus on its Burger King outlets, which helped lift earnings to R38 million ($2.5 million), compared with R27.1 million ($1.8 million) loss posted a year earlier.
