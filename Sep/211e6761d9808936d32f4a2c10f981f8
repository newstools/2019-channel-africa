In a statement, Sibanye-Stillwater said this was "pursuant to ongoing financial losses experienced at these operations with certain shafts having reached the end of their economic reserve lives". "The restructuring will result in the rationalisation of overheads and the realisation of other synergies and efficiencies required to restore profitability and ensure the sustainability of the remaining shafts at the Marikana operations," it said. The company and affected stakeholders would consider measures to avoid and mitigate possible retrenchments and seek alternatives to the potential cessation or downscaling of operations at affected shafts and associated services. The process followed a detailed three month review of the Marikana operation, following the acquisition of platinum producer Lonmin becoming effective in June. --IOL--
