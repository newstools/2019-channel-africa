According to Dagens Naeringsliv the deal should be announced at the end of September.

A source close to the negotiations, who requested not to be named, confirmed the timetable to AFP on Friday, but stressed that while the companies were in negotiations an agreement was still not certain.

"We have concluded a memorandum of understanding on possible negotiations," the source said.

The transaction would see ExxonMobil completely leave the Norwegian market after having had operations there for over a century.

It would also make Var Energi the country's second largest oil producer, after Equinor, with a production of 300 000 to 350 000 barrels a day.

"We are not commenting on ongoing discussions," Anne Fougner, ExxonMobil's spokeswoman in Norway, told AFP.

Var Energi could not immediately be reached for comment.

In June, Norwegian media reported that ExxonMobil intended to sell off its remaining Norwegian assets, after it already sold all the oil fields it operated in the country in 2017.
