They started the shortened 17 kilometres final stage from Riggton Farm to Drew Bridge with the Under 23 speedsters Alan Houston and Stew Little on their wave, but the Louw brothers took their chances well on the final leg to shake off them off and win their first Breede title by more than two minutes. "Because we raced the same section that we raced on the first day, everyone had learnt a few tricks so the racing was far harder and more tactical," said Ryan Louw. "The crews were all feeling each other out on the first stage but today the racing was much harder. The intervals were hard and all the top boats upped the ante, even though the river was actually a bit lower," he added. Third placed overnight the crew of Shaun Rubenstein and Clint Cook took the bull by the horns and scorched into the lead early on, before the Louw brothers pounced on an opportunity about half an hour into the race and went back to the front. "We wanted to make that stick and put in an interval, which got us a decent gap." said Ryan Louw. "We didn't want to risk being in a bunch as we got to the end of the race and to risk making a small mistake that could hand the lead to someone else." "Mission accomplished!" said his brother Greg Louw. "While it was low it was still really good fun, and it was a good training session for the Hansa Fish in a few weeksâ€™ time, which is our main goal for this season.
