Yet a certain symbolism would have been latched onto by many South African cricket observers on Wednesday as Kyle Abbott shattered a variety of long-standing first-class records for Hampshire at Southampton while on the same date the Proteas – in the throes of a really harrowing few months across the formats were being pretty close to schooled by India in a Twenty20 match at Mohali. Any direct comparison would be odious, of course: a four-day County Championship match in England differs in all sorts of ways to a T20 international in India. But Abbott’s quite superlative match haul of 17/86 (9/40 and 8/46) against title-hunting Somerset – beaten by 136 runs -- would nevertheless have sparked resurgent pangs of regret over his decision to give up his career for the South African national team in 2017 and pursue a Kolpak deal at the Rose Bowl. Now 32, but perhaps having cut around five years of yeoman further service to his country at the time he quit, the bustling, Empangeni-born customer gave, by all accounts, something of a masterclass first in seam and later in reverse-swing bowling against a Somerset side which included Indian Test veteran Murali Vijay (he duly ripped out the opener twice, amidst his broader carnage). Abbott’s match stats represented the best first-class ones anywhere since 1956, when England’s off-spinner Jim Laker claimed his iconic 19/90 against Australia in a Test match at Old Trafford. Laker died in 1986, aged 64, and no other bowler has taken more than 17 wickets in a single first-class match.
