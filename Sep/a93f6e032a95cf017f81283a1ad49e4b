Ali died at the age of 83. "We had confirmation of his death 30 minutes ago," the ministry said, without giving further details. His lawyer, Mounir Ben Salha, confirmed the news, citing family members and Ben Ali's doctor. Ben Ali, who ruled his North African country from 1987 until 2011, was viewed by some as a bulwark against Islamist extremism, but faced criticism for muzzling the opposition and his reluctance to embrace democracy. Eventually, growing frustration over unemployment and high prices snapped. In late 2010, the self-immolation of a young trader sparked major protests that rocked the country and sparked a deadly clampdown. Ben Ali fled Tunisia for Saudi Arabia on January 14, 2011. His rapid departure sparked a string of similar uprisings across the region, toppling Egyptian and Libyan strongmen Hosni Mubarak and Moamer Kadhafi. The turmoil triggered what was to become Syria's devastating eight-year war.
