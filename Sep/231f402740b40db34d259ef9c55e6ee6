The boat sank 10 kilometres from the coastline near the city of Sfax, Houssem Jebabli told Reuters, adding that the rescue operation continued. There have been two migrant shipping disasters off the Tunisian coast this year, with 86 African migrants drowned after their boat capsized having set off for Europe from Libya in July. Another boat taking migrants to Europe from Libya capsized in June, drowning at least 65 people. All the migrants traveling on the boat on Tuesday were Tunisians, Jebabli said.
