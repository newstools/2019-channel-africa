The England international has enjoyed an electric start to the Premier League season and already has five goals to his name from the first four games. Sterling also found himself on the scoresheet for the Three Lions on Saturday, as England secured a comfortable 4-0 victory over Bulgaria at Wembley. Having previously been criticised for struggling with his finishing, Sterling has made real progress under manager Pep Guardiola in recent seasons. Sterling's efforts have caught the eye of Cascarino and the former Chelsea striker feels the 24-year-old could go on to win the Ballon d'Or in the future.Â "I would definitely argue he's in the top five players in the world," he told talkSPORT. "What excites me about Sterling is the improvement. The improvement has been dramatic. Sterling will be hoping he can add to his goal tally if he gets an opportunity to feature in England's next Euro 2020 qualifier against Kosovo on Tuesday night. Meanwhile Manchester City, who currently sit in second place in the Premier League, return to action on Saturday when they make the trip to Carrow Road to face Norwich City.
