The 26-year-old missed most of last season with a serious knee injury but has shone on his return, his goal on Tuesday helping Liverpool go top of Group E with nine points. "I feel like I'm getting better," he told the club website. “I’ve been trying to sort of dribble a bit more and get that side of my game back because that sort of stuff can take a bit of a while when you’ve been out for a while. Overall, I think there’s more to come from me for sure.” Captain, Jordan Henderson, Fabinho and Georginio Wijnaldum have formed a solid midfield trio for Liverpool in recent months but Oxlade-Chamberlain’s goalscoring threat and playmaking qualities will give manager, Juergen Klopp a selection headache.  “To get into the team you’ve got to be able to press in a certain way with certain intensity,” Oxlade-Chamberlain said. “The way Gini, Hendo and Fab did it (against Tottenham Hotspur) was brilliant, if you’re not sort of hitting those standards then you’ll struggle to get a game regularly, so I’ve been battling to try to get that side of things back.” Liverpool host Premier League champions Manchester City on Sunday. --Reuters--
