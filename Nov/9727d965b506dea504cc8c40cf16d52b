Two unions representing more than 3 000 workers at South African Airways (SAA) have been on strike since November 15, after the airline rejected their demand for 8% raises and announced plans to cut 944 posts, forcing the cancellation of most flights.  

Now the National Union of Metalworkers is engaging its members at other airlines and companies that service the industry on whether they should stage sympathy strikes. The government’s approach to resolving the standoff could indicate how President Cyril Ramaphosa’s administration will tackle the thorny issue of bringing bloated wage bills at other state-owned companies under control. Public Enterprises Minister Pravin Gordhan indicated last week that it intends taking a hard line, saying SAA isn’t too big to fail. “What began as a strike for higher pay at SAA has morphed into an ideological clash and a direct challenge to the government,” said Gary van Staden, an analyst at NKC African Economics. If Ramaphosa buckles to the union’s demands, “he will find it that much harder in future to demonstrate his determination to take the tough decisions that any prospect of economic recovery requires,” he said. 

The metalworkers’ union said it has started consulting workers at maintenance companies and carriers including Mango Airlines, Safair Operations and SA Express with a view to intensifying the strike. 

While the union called for an urgent meeting with Gordhan and Finance Minister Tito Mboweni to discuss how to save the airline, they haven’t indicated whether they’ll accept.
