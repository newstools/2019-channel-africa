South Africans were left unable to watch Bafana's Thursday AFCON qualifier in Ghana after neither SuperSport nor the SABC screened the match. Thomas Partey and Kudus Mohammed netted a goal each as Ghana secured maximum points in a 2-0 win over South Africa at the Cape Coast Sports Stadium. Bafana coach Molefi Ntseki will be hoping to bounce back when South Africa face Sudan on Sunday. Meanwhile, the northeast African nation will be in good spirits after they ran out 4-0 winners over Sao Tome and Principe earlier in the week. Bafana are expected to depart Ghana on Friday morning as they shift their focus to Sunday's crucial clash at the Orlando Stadium. Kick-off is at 15:00 and screened live on SABC 1.
