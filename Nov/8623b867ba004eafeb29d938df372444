The Golden Eaglets, who are the most successful side in the tournament with five titles, suffered a 3-1 round of 16 defeat to the Netherlands on Wednesday. "There's no truth to reports in the media that the coach has been sacked," Sanusi said. "We understand the disappointment of the fans but the coach has a contract with the federation and there's no rush or whatsoever. "The standard procedure must be followed. For now the NFF technical committee is expecting a comprehensive technical report from the coach about the tournament in Brazil. "Any decisions going toward will be presented to the board by the technical committee." His comments came after Nigeria's sports minister Sunday Dare called for a review of the campaign in Brazil and of the Nigeria football (NFF) administration. "Indeed, our football administration at all levels calls for a review. We must exact greater responsibility from those charged with our football administration." The NFF has been under scrutiny both on and off the pitch in recent months. The case, which was made up of 16 charges, was dismissed at the Abuja High Court on Tuesday following the dissolution of the Special Presidential Investigation Panel (SPIP) which charged the officials in September. --BBC--
