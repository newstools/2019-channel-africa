Under the deal, South32 will receive 49% of the cash flow generated by South32 SA Coal Holdings Proprietary Ltd (SAEC), with payments capped at R1.5 billion ($101 million) per year, starting from the completion of the deal to March 2024. South32 does not anticipate to report a taxable profit on the deal, from either the upfront or deferred consideration, the company said in a statement. The transaction will “substantially reduce our capital intensity, strengthen our balance sheet and will improve the Group’s operating margin”, South32 Chief Executive Officer, Graham Kerr, said. Johannesburg-based Seriti and the two trusts will acquire South32’s 91.84% stake in SAEC with the upfront cash payment, based on an enterprise value of R1.25 billion ($84.4 million). South32 is the latest company to get out of energy coal at a time when investor pressure and climate change concerns are prompting businesses to limit their exposure to fossil fuels.
