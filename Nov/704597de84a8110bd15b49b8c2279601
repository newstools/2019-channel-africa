The company, 40% owned by the state, has been investing heavily in its mobile business to drive growth, but also adding to a debt burden. Telkom said in a stock exchange announcement on Tuesday it was in discussions in relation to a potential acquisition - one move that it has previously warned could cause push debt up further. “We are always on the lookout for the right asset at the right price,” Chief Executive Officer Sipho Maseko told Reuters by phone. The company had previously looked at Cell C, South Africa’s third largest mobile operator with its own financial problems, and would only consider it within a disciplined financial framework, he said. Amid a drop in fixed-line customers, Telkom has ploughed funds into areas such as mobile and fiber. Like other African telecoms firms, it is trying to keep pace with a surge in demand for the internet and data with growing smart phone usage.
