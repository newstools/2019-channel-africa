Shameel Joosub, Vodacom Group chief executive said following last year’s substantial investment in South Africa’s largest broad-based black economic empowerment (B-BBEE) transaction in the telecommunication sector, this year Vodacom Group posted an 18.9 % increase in headline earnings per share to 460c and returning a dividend of 440 cents per share to shareholders. “In South Africa, an increase in data usage, following sustained efforts to reduce data prices and the on boarding of our new roaming partner in the second quarter, more than offset the service revenue decline reported in the first three months of the financial year. “On a like-for-like basis, this resulted in service revenue growth of 1.5 % during the half-year, despite on-going economic pressures and the implementation of the End-User and Subscriber Service Charter Regulations. South Africa service revenue grew 0.3 %, supported by the turnaround to growth in the second quarter, as the reduction in out-of-bundle revenue was offset by improved data elasticity and the completion of the full on boarding of our new roaming partner. International operations continued to perform well, delivering service revenue growth of 15.5 % from 8.7 % in the previous comparable period, with foreign currency translations boosting reported Group growth. --IOL--
