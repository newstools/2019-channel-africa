De Ruyter, who will start his role at Eskom on January 15, 2020, is tasked with splitting the utility into separate units for generation, transmission and distribution, under a plan approved by President Cyril Ramaphosa. De Ruyter will leave his post at packaging group, Nampak, the company said in a statement. Eskom’s previous CEO, Phakamani Hadebe, resigned earlier this year for health reasons, complicating government efforts to turn around the struggling utility. Hadebe was the 10th CEO in a decade to quit the state company in what has proved a revolving door of top executives and board members. Eskom, which supplies more than 90% of the power in Africa’s most advanced economy, is dependent on government bailouts and is deep in crisis as sales decline while debt-service costs soar. Eskom also faces generation capacity constraints, with South Africa plagued by power cuts in recent months, undermining broader efforts to kick-start growth. “I would like to thank De Ruyter for not only accepting this position at a difficult time for Eskom, but, given Eskom’s current financial situation, also agreeing to a lower compensation package than the position currently pays,” Public Enterprises Minister, Pravin Gordhan said in the statement. --Reuters--
