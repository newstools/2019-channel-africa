Hope made 109 and built crucial partnerships including an unbeaten 71-run stand with Roston Chase, 42 not out, to anchor West Indies' chase of 250 with eight balls to spare in Lucknow. The wicketkeeper-batsman completed his seventh ODI 100 as West Indies, under nfew limited-overs captain Kieron Pollard, recorded their first ODI whitewash since 2014. "We came here with a mission and specific roles for players, and all the players deserve credit," said Pollard. "Winning is a habit, and anything that we want to do as a team is a process, and it's something we had to improve in a period of time. "This was an opportunity for us to show we have that kind of venom inside us. We knew we had to rally as a team, and we proved we can bat 50 overs, and once we do that, we can win games." Paceman Keemo Paul played a key role in the win, returning figures of 3-44 in Afghanistan's 249/7. Afghanistan's teenage spinner, Mujeeb Ur Rahman, took two wickets to reduce West Indies to four for two but Hope stood firm to keep the chase on track.
