Pollard sustained the injury in last Saturday's 32-12 win over England in the Rugby World Cup final in Yokohama. He contributed 22 points with his boot in the final, helping the Springboks claim their third World Cup title. Pollard took to social media on Wednesday where he shared a photo of himself in hospital. Pollard finished the World Cup as the leading points scorer, with 69, and also landed the most penalties (16). The 25-year-old is set to leave the Bulls for French club Montpellier but it's uncertain for how long he'll be sidelined. The Springboks kick off their 'Champions Tour' in Gauteng on Thursday.
