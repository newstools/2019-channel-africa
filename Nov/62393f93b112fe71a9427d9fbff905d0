Parents send their children to be cured of autism, Director of Dewdrops community centre for special needs, in Abuja, Omolola Aneke, said. She said that the parents misunderstand the condition and believe that hitting children will change their behaviour. Police in Nigeria have recently started raiding the illegal detention centres that relatives send children they believe are possessed or addicted to drugs. Earlier this week police rescued 259 captives from an illegal detention centre in a mosque in Ibadan, in the south-western state of Oyo. In the past month, more than 1 000 people have been rescued from similar institutions in Nigeria. Police have found people chained, starved and abused. --BBC--
