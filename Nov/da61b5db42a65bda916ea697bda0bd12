President Ramaphosa, who was interviewed on SABC News, said the strike is a "labour relations issue" that should not cause panic, even as passengers were reported to have been stranded at the country's main airport. He said the airline's management should come up with a solution to end the strike that started on Friday. SAA has cancelled all flights scheduled for Friday and Saturday because of the strike. “This happens all the time in various companies and in various sectors and I don’t believe that we should panic,” President Ramaphosa told the SABC News. "In labour relations things do get off the rails from time to time and it really depends on cool heads and I'm hoping that they would be cool-headed people on both sides," he added. The airline's workers are protesting against a restructuring process that could lead to the loss of more than 900 jobs. Eyewitness News reported that passengers were stranded at the OR Tambo International Airport. The airline's spokesperson Tiali Tiali has said that striking workers will not be paid for the days they will be out of work. --BBC--
