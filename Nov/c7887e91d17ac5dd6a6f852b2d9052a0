Spar jumped the most since 2015 after the group said that its profit increased 18.4% to R2.16 billion($140 million) from R1.83bn($120 million) last year, while turnover inched up 8.4% to R109.5bn($7.32 billion) against the backdrop of markets that remain tough in all regions of operations. The group said operating profit surged 7.2% to R3bn( $200 million), while diluted headline earnings per share increased 9.9% to 1 160.6 cents a share. The group declared a 9.7% increase in dividend to 800c. Jordan Weir, a trader at Citadel, said the results were ahead of the market expectations. “Spar’s results came in slightly higher than analysts’ expectations, even though poor consumer sentiment veiled the market over the last financial period. The stronger earnings are mainly attributable to a well-executed management of costs throughout the business, as well as efficient margin management on products,” Weir said. Spar Southern Africa reported an 8% growth in wholesale turnover to R74.3bn($4.97 billion), and the result includes the S Buys pharmaceutical business acquired in the 2018 financial year. The liquor division, Tops, again reported a strong performance, with retail turnover up 14.5% to R12.8bn( $860 million) as ongoing marketing initiatives and a refreshed brand image won consumer spend. The Tops network increased by 48 stores on a net basis to 822 stores, while 47 stores were revamped. Hardware section Build It upped its sales 6% to R8bn($530 million), and The Spar Southern Africa store network increased to 2349 stores, with 169 new stores opened. The group completed 298 store upgrades across all brands. In Ireland, the BWG Group again delivered a strong financial result and reported euro-denominated turnover growth of 6.2% to 1.5bn (R24.61bn)($1.65 billion). The group said this number was boosted by the recent business acquisitions. Spar Switzerland reported turnover of R10.4bn($700 million), but operating profit decreased 33.2% to R83.3 million($5.57 million). Tasneem Samodien, an analyst at Old Mutual Wealth Private Client Securities, said Spar generated a resilient performance in a constrained local retail environment. “While revenue growth was driven by a strong contribution from all regions and lines of business, Tops stood out, generating 14.5 % revenue growth during the period. A strong top-line performance contributed to an 18.4% increase in profit after tax to R2.1bn($140 million),” Samodien said. Spar said in southern Africa all indicators continue to suggest that consumers will remain under financial pressure, and confidence is to remain unchanged in the medium term. “Against this economic backdrop, Spar’s extensive distribution capability and market-leading brands will ensure that its independent retailers remain suitably positioned to deliver exceptional value to consumers,” the group said. Spar shares gained 5.55%to close at R209($13.97) on the JSE on Thursday.
