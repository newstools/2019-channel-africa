The New Zealand-born Gatland told Radio Sport his loyalties lie with Super Rugby outfit the Chiefs and coaching the British and Irish Lions in 2021. New Zealand Rugby has invited 26 New Zealand coaches to apply for the All Blacks coaching post vacated by Steve Hansen, and has previously said if Gatland wanted to be considered then he would have to give up the Lions role. "It was nice to be contacted. I politely declined putting my name forward," Gatland said. "I am a little bit old school. I'd made the commitment to the Chiefs and I'd made the commitment to the Lions, it was important that I carry on with that, honour the commitment I made to those two sides." Gatland said if the chance to coach the All Blacks arose again in the future he would consider it, but if not then he had no regrets. "I am a great believer in what will be will be," he said. "If you are successful, other opportunities will come along. It was time for me to make a decision to leave Wales and the northern hemisphere and come back to New Zealand and I'm excited by that."
