Unsurprisingly the Liverpool duo of Sadio Mane (Senegal) and Mo Salah (Egypt) are on the lost and will be strong contenders to be in the final XI. In all Liverpool had 10 players on the 50-man list following their victory in the 2018/19 UEFA Champions League. There are also two Ajax Amsterdam players after their run to the semifinals of the Champions league, with goalkeeper Andre Onana (Cameroon) and Hakim Ziyech (Morocco) on the list. Napoli defender Kalidou Koulibaly (Ivory Coast) is also there along with Arsenal forward Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang (Gabon). In all there are 14 clubs represented on the list and players from 21 countries, with 25 footballers plying their trade in England making the cut. Paris Saint-Germain forward Kylian Mbapp√©, 20, is the youngest nominee and Juventus winger Cristiano Ronaldo, 34, the oldest. --AllAfrica--
