The rice fields collect stagnant water, which is where malaria-carrying mosquitoes lay their eggs. Researchers from Radboud University in The Netherlands will monitor whether the film will prevent anopheles mosquitoes' eggs from hatching by blocking the larvae from attaching to the surface of the water. The researchers told Reuters news agency that they chose Tanzania's semi-autonomous archipelago to test the idea because of their progressive drone regulations. The tests are at an early stage. After the trial, the researchers aim to publish their findings in peer-reviewed journals before testing it again across the continent. --BBC--
