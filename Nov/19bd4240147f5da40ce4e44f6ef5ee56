Authorities said the fire began four days ago and spread rapidly due to strong winds and flammable bush grass. They suspect that it was started by farmers who have encroached on the land or traditional gold miners. A worker at the park, Zeneb Arfaine, told the BBC that police and residents had been helping to battle the blaze. Earlier reports indicated that the fire was contained but fresh flames then broke out in another part of the park. The blaze has put wildlife under threat. Officials at the park said wildfires there are an annual occurrence. Kafta Sheraro National Park was established in 2007 and is managed by the Ethiopia Wildlife Conservation Authority. --BBC--
