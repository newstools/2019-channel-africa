Drone and missile attacks on September 14 on two plants at the heart of Saudi Arabia’s oil industry, Abqaiq and Khurais, temporarily knocked out more than half the Kingdom’s output. The United States said Iran sponsored the attacks, a claim which Tehran denied. September crude output fell by 660 000 bpd to 9.129 million bpd, figures from the Joint Organisations Data Initiative (JODI) showed. Crude stocks fell by 20.27 million bpd to 152.48 million bpd while domestic refinery crude throughput rose by 10 000 bpd to 2.584 million bpd, the data showed. Following the attacks the kingdom managed to maintain supplies to customers partly by drawing from its huge oil inventories. Saudi Arabia and other members of the Organisation of the Petroleum Exporting Countries provide monthly export figures to the JODI which publishes them on its website. --Reuters--
