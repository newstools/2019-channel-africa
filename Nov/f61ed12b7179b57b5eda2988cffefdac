The Monegasque said that he and four-time world champion Sebastian Vettel should be less aggressive and try to avoid another similar collision in the future. The pair were summoned to 'clear-the-air' talks last week at Ferrari's Maranello headquarters where they analysed the accident and reflected on the conclusions. "We looked at it and I particularly looked at it, obviously, to try and understand how we could have made things better," said Leclerc during a scheduled news conference ahead of Sunday's season-ending Abu Dhabi Grand Prix. "I think it was very unfortunate, firstly because the touch was extremely small and had a big drama after that. So that was a little bit unlucky. As a team, I think we probably should try to be a bit less aggressive between each other for these things to not happen again. "For the team it is not good. For everyone that is supporting us, it's not good. So we need to try for it to not happen again." Leclerc added that he did not believe that Ferrari would consider imposing team orders to stop them racing each other for position. "I think this will not change," he said. "We will be able to race together. Obviously, Seb and myself are very competitive. "We both want to win, but also we need to find the right compromise. We are also racing for the same team."
