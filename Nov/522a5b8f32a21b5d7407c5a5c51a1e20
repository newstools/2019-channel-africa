Far from letting go of Misr Spinning & Weaving Co in the Nile Delta city of Al-Mahalla al-Kubra, however, the government has placed it at the centre of an ambitious plan to rescue loss-making national firms in the once-thriving textiles sector. The plan shows how the government has reversed a trend under President Hosni Mubarak, who was ousted in 2011, of turning public enterprises over to the private sector, doubling down instead on its support of state firms. It will also provide a crucial test of Egypt's ability to boost job-creating industry as it exits a three-year reform programme backed by the International Monetary Fund. Economists have praised the reforms for contributing to stability and growth, which was a robust 5.6% in the third quarter. But outside the energy sector, the economy has been shrinking. The story of the Mahalla factory reflects a longer-term decline. It was set up by Egyptian businessmen in 1927 to make textiles from Egypt's renowned long-staple cotton, until then exported raw to manufacturers abroad. But the country's army rulers nationalised it in the early1960s along with most of Egyptian industry, and Egypt's textile sector was later overtaken by competition from Asia. Apart from a brief period of hiring in the post-2011 political turmoil, the factory had all but stopped taking on new workers for decades, allowing the workforce to shrink as employees retired or resigned. At a small grocery store opposite the company gate, workers last month said the company's three plants were operating at no more than 40% capacity. "Machines have stopped and the three plants are not productive. Every month, salaries are 10 days late and annual bonuses are delayed," said one worker who asked not to be identified. --Reuters--
