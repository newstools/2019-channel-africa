A November 28, 2019 statement from the Eritrean Ministry of Information said the Qatari government was deploying religious, political and guerilla tactics to achieve its aim of destabilizing Eritrea. The current development is the latest round of accusation that Asmara is throwing at Doha. Eritrea has also in the past jabbed the Doha-based Al Jazeera news outlet for biased and unprofessional reportage on the country. Eritrea says the 10-point scheme of subversion that Qatar has mapped out consists of plans to regroup Eritrean opposition political leaders, unify their associations and extend requisite support to the latter and to give special focus to Eritrean youth, unify their associations and incite them to engage in acts of rebellion against the Eritrean government, among others. The Ministry said the points raised were in “brief and skeletal form.” Asmara holds however that Qatar and its unnamed sponsors and minions continue to see their chances of success growing slimmer. --AfricaNews--
