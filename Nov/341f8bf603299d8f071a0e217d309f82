Three over-age players are allowed per team in the tournament. SA had goalkeeper Itumeleng Khune and defender Eric Mathoho as two over-age players at the 2016 Rio Olympics in Brazil. Egypt have already indicated that Liverpool superstar Mo Salah will be part of their squad. SA qualified for their second Olympics in a row after they defeated Ghana on penalties in the U23 Africa Cup of Nations in Egypt on Friday. Goalkeeper Mondli Mpoto saved two penalties to help his team through. Mpoto returned for the play-off match after he missed out in the other matches. Darren Johnson did well to keep a clean sheet until the semi-finals. SA drew goalless with Zambia, beat Ivory Coast 1-0 and drew 0-0 against Nigeria in the group stages to reach the semi-finals. They then lost to Egypt 3-0 before beating Ghana on penalties after the match ended 2-2 in extra time. Notoane was not happy they scored only three goals in the tournament. SA did well in defence not conceding a goal until the semi-final clash against Egypt and also against Ghana. Notoane was happy with the defence. Egypt won the tournament following a 2-1 win over Ivory Coast in extra time. SA finished third followed by Ghana in fourth. Notoane says it was a high-quality tourney.
