The striker got up off the turf after being fouled by Thiago Silva in the 74th minute of the game at the Parc des Princes on Wednesday and took the kick himself, instead of designated penalty taker Hans Vanaken, but had a feeble effort saved by PSG goalkeeper Keylor Navas. It effectively cost his side a valuable point, as they lost by a single goal, leaving them with just two points from four matches in Group A. 

The 23-year-old Senegal international had been fined and left out of the squad for Sunday’s Belgian league encounter at Antwerp and coach Philippe Clement said he would still decide whether he would play for Brugge in the future. “It was a dumb mistake. A mistake that had consequences for the result and we are all very cross about it,” he told a news conference. “This sort of incident leads to emotions and there was a confrontation in the change room after, but it was verbal and not physical. Diagne realised he made mistake and did not argue back.” 

Clement said a strong punishment was needed and that Diagne’s future at the club would depend on his reaction in the coming weeks. He is on loan from Galatasaray. “We have had disciplinary incidents at this club in the past and players have been given a second chance. It is now up to Diagne to show that he accepts and understands the norms and values of our club. 

“He can still have a future with us although it depends on what he shows in the coming weeks.” Clement also told reporters criticism of Vanaken for not being more forceful in insisting on taking the kick, as prearranged, was wrong. “Some have suggested he didn’t want to accept the responsibility but he told Diagne not to take the kick. 

“But when he realised this was not going to happen, he did not want to get into an argument on the biggest stage in the world. I’m proud of the way Hans dealt with the situation,” the coach added. --AllAfrica--
