In September Busola Dakolo accused Pastor Biodun Fatoyinbo from the Commonwealth of Zion Assembly of raping her twice. She said that it happened more than 20 years ago, before she turned 18. Nigerian media report that another, unnamed woman came forward alleging that Pastor Fatoyinbo raped her in 2017. He has denied all accusations, saying earlier this year: "I have never in my life raped anybody." Dakolo's allegations went viral on social media, with some saying it had triggered Nigeria's #MeToo moment. In his ruling, Justice Oathman Musa said that the case is "empty and purely sentimental" and also ordered Dakolo to pay $2 750 for wasting the court's time. She has said she will appeal the ruling, local newspaper Punch quoted her lawyer as saying. The Nigeria police opened investigations into the matter and could file criminal charges separate from Dakoloâ€™s suit. --BBC--
