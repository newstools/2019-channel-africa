Five buses carrying staff of Canadian firm Semafo were ambushed on Wednesday about 40km from the eastern town of Boungou, reports say. A military escort vehicle was reportedly struck by an explosive device before gunmen opened fire. It is said to be the third deadliest attack on Semafo staff in 15 months. Burkina Faso has been wracked by an Islamist insurgency that has killed hundreds of people in recent years. The military has struggled to contain violence that spilled over the border from neighbouring Mali. Following two attacks in August last year, the company updated its security measures near its two mines in the country, as well as the travel arrangements. The latest attack happened on a road between Fada and its mine in Boungou, the company said. Semafo said its operations had not been affected and offered condolences to the families of the victims, none of whom have been named. "We are actively working with all levels of authorities to ensure the on-going safety and security of our employees, contractors and suppliers," the firm said. --BBC--
