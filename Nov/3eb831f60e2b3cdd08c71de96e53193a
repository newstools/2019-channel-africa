Despite feeling 'under the weather', Lorenzo-Vera equalled his lowest round of the season to set the early pace on 9-under par in the final Rolex Series event of 2019 and even held a three-shot advantage at one point until McIlroy produced his own spectacular finish. "Honestly I'm not the feeling well at all. I have no energy. I was down, I had a lung infection in South Africa and a lot of treatment, and really just feel bad on top of that," said Lorenzo-Vera. "I'm just trying to do well in every part of the performance and sometimes it clicks and sometimes it doesn't click. I have a lot to do better to be more consistent on good weeks. That's why I think I haven't won yet. There's plenty of work to do." Former world number one McIlroy birdied the 15 and 16 holes then executed his 'best shot of the year' on the last, a majestic three wood from 290 yards which finished five feet from the pin, en route to a closing eagle. The Northern Irishman, who also posted five birdies on the front nine, carded an eight under par 64 as he chases back-to-back European Tour victories following his win in the WGC-HSBC Champions three weeks ago. Both players will have their eyes on the title and the $3 million winner's cheque - the richest first prize in tournament golf - while Jon Rahm has that and the Race to Dubai title in his sights after opening with a six under par 66. The Spaniard is currently third in the tournament and third in the Race to Dubai, and he bolstered his chances of overhauling Bernd Wiesberger in the contest to become European's Number One with four birdies on the back nine. England's Tommy Fleetwood also put the pressure on Race to Dubai leader Wiesberger - his playing partner in the opening round - by holing his second shot on the first hole for an eagle and birdieing the second.Â
