UN Resident Co-ordinator, Maria Jose Torres, said Malawians should "respect each other’s religious beliefs and engage in peaceful dialogue to resolve:" The Monday incident at M’manga school sparked violence between Christian and Muslim groups that left at least two people seriously injured, according to local newspaper The Daily Times. Shops, a mosque, an Anglican church and a priest’s house were also destroyed, the paper reports. The Anglican Church, which runs M’manga school, had stopped students from wearing hijabs. Torres said intolerance could "deny girls the right to learn".
