Luyanda Botha, a former post office worker, is accused of committing the crimes in August. He has not pleaded yet. The victim, a student at the University of Cape Town, was bludgeoned to death with a metal pole at the Clareinch post office where she had gone to collect a parcel. Botha walked into the dock on Tuesday covered in a black hoodie and was met by a crowd that called on him to reveal his face. The matter is expected to be moved to a higher court. Mrwetyanaâ€™s death caused outrage, prompted protests across the country and led to the social media campaign called #AmINext which drew attention to violence against women. Subsequently, President Cyril Ramaphosa promised tougher action against sexual offenders as well and better service when reporting cases. --BBC--
