The group was hit by a lack of infrastructure development in the country, the demise of numerous large local construction companies, a downturn in the Asian market and a drought in the agricultural sector. This resulted in the Capital Equipment Group segment reporting a decline of 8% in revenue to R2.3 billion($160 million), while its operating profit before interest on capital equipment financing transactions and foreign exchange movements decreased by 21% to R148 million( $9.99 million) in the six months to end September. Chief executive Arnold Goldstone said yesterday that a lack of liquidity and uncertainty in the agricultural sector resulted in a decline in demand for combine harvesters and higher kilowatt tractors. Despite the decline in volumes in every construction equipment sector, there is still activity in higher value, large equipment used in the mining sector,” Goldstone said. However, despite the decline in CEG, the group still managed to grow its overall profits by 228% to R208m($14.05 million), up from R63m($4.25 million) compared to last year, as a result of the non-occurrence of the once-off tax provision. In September 2018 results, the group reached a settlement with SA Revenue Service for a settlement of R750m($50.65 millio). Invicta maintained its group revenue at R5.3bn( $360 million) and operating profit declined by 6% to R383m($25.86 million). Its basic earnings per share increased by 1 046% to 149 cents a share and headline earnings per share increased by 2 029% to 149c. The group did not declare a dividend,given the higher gearing levels, and said it would resume a normal dividend policy once cash flow and debt levels permit. Goldstone said a pleasing feature of the period had been the major improvement in cash generated from operations that increased by 426% from R99m($6.69 million) to R518m($34.98 million) for the current period. “Invicta’s strategic focus is based upon optimising current operations and cash flows to right-sizing the level of debt that resulted from the 2018 tax settlement of R750m($50.65 million),” he said. Invicta shares closed 4.50% lower at R21($1.42) on the JSE on Monday. --BUSINESS REPORT--
