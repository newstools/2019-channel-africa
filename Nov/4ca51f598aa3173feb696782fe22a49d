The Building Bridges Initiatives (BBI), as the report is called, was an idea of President Uhuru Kenyatta and opposition leader, Raila Odinga, aimed at uniting the country following the contentious 2017 election which, like past polls, was hit by violence. The team writing the report was tasked to address electoral reforms, ethnic and gender inclusivity, and political representation among other issues. Some of the proposals they have made include the creation of a prime minister post, banning state workers from doing business with the government, and awarding corruption whistleblowers 5% of the amount recovered. A local television station gave highlights of the BBI report. Some critics however have been scathing of BBI, saying it was an initiative meant to preserve the status of the political class.

Other critics say that Kenya's constitution, in force since 2010, would solve the problems the country faces if it was "fully" implemented. Others have praised the BBI initiative saying it is a "a new vision" for Kenya.

--BBC-- Inside The #BBIReport:Report contains many reform proposals#NewsNight@WaihigaMwaura pic.twitter.com/FUMZKu1Mzt I have read the full BBI report. A thumping endorsement of the wretched status quo. A total repudiation of a bright future. Desultory and Insincere. A report made to entrench the rule of the ruling class. A false dawn. Another instance of CRUELLY taking the people for ride. pic.twitter.com/1UOE3l6tWF I confirm have finished reading the final #BBI report. Bomas will only be fury political rhetorical speeches for politicians. BBI was political placating exercise to restore normalcy and stability. Implement constitution of Kenya 2010 fully and faithfully. BRIDGING THE DIVIDEDr. Sam Kamau, Political Analyst: BBI is a good report & an attempt to diagnose the problems we are facing in the country. It seems to offer a new vision for a new Kenya & a better pathway for a better future #DayBreak pic.twitter.com/e0qxlnaIV9
