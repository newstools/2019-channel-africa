The Cairo club’s president Mortada Mansour says the board took the decision because they view Qatar as hostile to Egypt after political tensions between the two nations. “Zamalek board took the decision to not play the Super Cup in Qatar because it is hostile to Egypt,” Mansour told reporters. “We discussed our opinions together on the board meeting, some took the game from a sporting perspective and others objected playing looking from a political point of view and seeing that Qatar works on destructing Egypt.” Mansour has been consistent in suggesting his side will not fulfill the fixture since it was announced by CAF last week, saying he would even accept playing at Esperance’s home in Tunis instead. Zamalek qualify to meet Champions League winners Esperance by virtue of their victory in the 2018-19 CAF Confederation Cup. CAF have yet to respond, but their only option, if they are to push ahead with the fixture, appears to be to hand a place to Confed Cup runners-up RS Berkane from Morocco. They will likely act against Zamalek though, which could include a continental ban. --AllAfrica--
