Commenting for the first time since a military camp was overrun by jihadists on Friday, Ibrahim Boubakar Keita said the stability and the very existence of the country were at stake. He called for international solidarity in the fight against the jihadists. It comes at a time when there's growing anger that the highly mobile jihadists appear to be winning the war, and not for the first time. Seven years ago Islamist militants seized most of northern Mali, a move that prompted France to intervene. Thousands of French troops are still in the region but along with soldiers from several West African armies, they have been unable to stop the attacks by Islamic State in the Greater Sahara and Al Qaeda linked jihadists. --BBC--
