Watling's 205 helped the Black Caps triumph over England by an innings and 65 runs in their first Test in Tauranga. That double century saw him move up the latest ICC Test rankings, rising 12 places to 12th position. De Kock is the highest ranked South African Test batsman and currently sits in 16th position. Black Caps fast bowler Neil Wagner, who was born in Pretoria, also shot up in the latest ICC rankings after his match-winning 5-44 against England. Wagner's eight-wicket match haul has catapulted him to a career-best third position and is 23 points away from overtaking Proteas bowler Kagiso Rabada in second place. Meanwhile, Proteas seamer Vernon Philander has moved up two places to seventh position, despite not playing any Tests. The Proteas kick off their summer when they host England for four Tests, starting on December 26 at Centurion.
