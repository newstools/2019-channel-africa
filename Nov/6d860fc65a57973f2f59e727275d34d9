The IMF visited South Africa from November 6-21 to discuss economic and financial developments as part of its bi-annual surveillance function. "The IMF recommends that South Africa creates an environment conducive for private sector investment and take a decisive approach to implement structural reforms in order to boost economic growth," said a statement.

According to Treasury, the global lender also highlighted the major challenges facing the economy, which include weak growth, a deteriorating fiscal situation and difficulties in the operations of state owned enterprise. In October, Treasury downgraded growth forecast to just 0.5% for this year, down from the 1.5% projection made in the February, as the economy battles high unemployment and a rising public service wage bill. The country's loss-making public entities also continue to put pressure on the public purse, with government constantly extending bailouts and guarantees to support the companies. The impact of continued support has been flagged by ratings agencies who have called  for urgent reforms to address the current economic malaise. Treasury said the proposal raised by the IMF were in line with areas that government was working on to stimulate growth, improve the overall fiscal position and address inefficiencies in State-Owned Entities. They pointed at interventions which have been undertaken since previous IMF visit in May, which include the approval of the Integrated Resources Plan, simplified visa regime and the scrapping of a requirement for unabridged birth certificate for children entering the country.

The  cumbersome regulation was widely blamed for low tourist numbers to the country.
