The sanctions were imposed nearly two decades ago. Addressing a press conference on Wednesday at the closure of a two-day workshop on the Zimbabwe Democracy and Economic Recovery Act (ZIDERA) and sanctions, POLAD co-convener and National Peace and Reconciliation Commission chairperson Justice Selo Nare said sanctions were a threat to life. POLAD is an assembly of 17 political parties that participated in harmonised elections last year. --Herald--
