"Foreigners should use official border crossing points," said Tete province's police spokespersonn Feliciano de Camara. "Whenever we come across law-breakers, procedures, including repatriation to their place of origin, will be taken." He said beefed up patrols meant that over the last weekend alone, 200 more people than usual were caught trying to illegally enter Tete province. Many migrants use Mozambique as a transit point on their way to southern Africa's economic hub, South Africa, for greener pastures. Those who settle in Mozambique often find work, particularly in the gas, coal and aluminium industries. --BBC--
