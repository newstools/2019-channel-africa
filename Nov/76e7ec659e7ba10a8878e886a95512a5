Hundreds of families have been made homeless and fled. Thirty other people are still missing. Weather experts in East Africa are warning of a continued, heavy downpour that could bring more devastation, particularly in landslide-prone areas. "Floodplains that are receiving heavy rainfall are also at risk", said Samwel Mwangi of Kenyaâ€™s meteorological department. "Governments are always prepared, but acts of nature like this can never be 100% prepared for," he told the BBC. "We are giving early warning information and deploying emergency operations to remove people from areas that are high risk." --BBC--
