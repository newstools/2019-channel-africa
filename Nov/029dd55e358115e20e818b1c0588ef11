It put New Zealand in an unbeatable position in the two-Test series and extended their home streak to a remarkable seven series without defeat. England were on the ropes with only two wickets remaining at tea before Sam Curran and Jofra Archer staged a late rally with a 59-run stand for the ninth wicket. But with fewer than 22 overs remaining in the match, Wagner brought proceedings to an abrupt halt when he removed Archer and Stuart Broad, the last man in, with successive balls. England had started the final day at three for 55 and 207 runs away from making New Zealand bat again. In what began as a dogged fight for survival they crept along with a mere 66 runs off the first 41 overs for the loss of only Joe Root's wicket for 11, completing a disappointing match for the England skipper after his two in the first innings. Ben Stokes joined Joe Denly to continue England's defiance until nine overs after lunch when their patience ran out and New Zealand cashed in. Stokes, on 28, chased a wide Tim Southee delivery that should have been left and chopped it on to his stumps. Wagner, who had been wicketless at that stage, revved up his left-arm bouncers and accounted for Joe Denly, Ollie Pope and Jos Buttler in quick succession as England lost four wickets for 17 runs. Denly, who delivered a solid 74 for England in the first innings, top-scored the second time around with 35 before he was caught behind. Pope was on six when, like Stokes, he chased a ball he should have left alone. Pope stretched to a wide full toss from Wagner and was caught by a diving Mitchell Santner at short cover.
