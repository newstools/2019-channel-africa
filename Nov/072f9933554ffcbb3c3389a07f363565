A number of English-based players have been dropped from the list, but there is room for Charlton Athletic striker Macauley Bonne after he received his Zimbabwe passport last week. The players that have dropped out are Douglas Nyaupembe (Stockport County, England), Tivonge Rushesha (Swansea City, England), Adam Chicksen (Bolton Wanderers, England), Jordan Zemura (Bournemouth, England), Phenias Bamusi (Caps), Jonah Fabisch (Hamburger SV, Germany), Admiral Muskwe (Leicester City, England) and Evans Rusike (SuperSport United, South Africa). Teenager Fabisch, the son of former coach Reinhard, asked that his future with the national team be put on hold while he seeks a first team place at Hamburg. Zimbabwe host Botswana on Friday at the National Sports Stadium in Harare before travelling to play Zambia next Tuesday.
