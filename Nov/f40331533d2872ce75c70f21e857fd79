Egypt, Ethiopia and Sudan have all been invited to the meeting hosted by United States (US) Treasury Secretary, Steven Mnuchin. The Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam, being built on the Blue Nile tributary in northern Ethiopia, will create Africa's largest hydroelectric power station. But Egypt fears the project will allow Ethiopia to control the river's flow. It has been a long-standing source of tension between the two countries. Last week, Egyptian Foreign Minister, Sameh Shoukry said the talks were aimed at breaking "the deadlock in the on-going negotiations", AFP news agency reported. But Ethiopia does not see the meeting in Washington that way. "This is not a platform for technical negotiations," Ethiopia's foreign ministry Spokesperson Nebiat Getachew said. "We will go there and all the parties involved in the negotiations will explain their position. â€œThis is not a negotiation and the US is not mediating. That cannot be the right language." Nebiat said negotiations are taking place between the countries' water ministers, adding that a technical solution can be found to Egypt's concerns. Last month, Ethiopian Prime Minister, Abiy Ahmed told parliamentarians in Addis Ababa that "no force can stop Ethiopia" from building the dam. "The people of Ethiopia have no desire to harm the people of Egypt, they only need to get benefit from the dam," he added. --BBC--
