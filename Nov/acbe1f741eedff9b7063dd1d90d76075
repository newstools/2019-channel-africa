Campaigners from the Lucha social justice group and Operation Filimbi (meaning "Whistle Blowers") gathered in the city Goma. They carried a banner calling for the UN peacekeeping force to leave the country and said President FÃ©lix Tshisekedi must take action to improve the Congolese army. The protest comes in the wake of news of the killing of three health workers fighting to curb the spread of the Ebola virus. The attacks by suspected Mai-Mai rebels occurred in Ituri province, north of Goma. The demonstrators were also complaining about Sunday's killing of several villagers near the city of Beni. That attack was said to have been carried out by a rebel group known as the Allied Democratic Forces The activists said the UN and government have left civilians at the mercy of the attackers. On Monday, a group of protesters in Beni torched a UN military base and the town hall there. --BBC--
