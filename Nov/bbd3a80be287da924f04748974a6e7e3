Emanuel Eyasu, from pro-opposition Assena TV station, had been lured by a contact about a story and was then attacked by a liquid made of milk, eggs and flour. During the incident one person was arrested by police, while the others escaped. Last year,a similar tactic was used to attack former BBC journalist Martin Plaut. Pro-Eritrean government activist Jacob Ghebremeohin was found guilty of assault and fined over that attack.
