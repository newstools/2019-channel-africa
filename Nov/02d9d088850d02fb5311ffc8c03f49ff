Banks like HSBC and Standard Chartered were "directly culpable" in the looting of government funds during Zuma's presidency, Lord Hain said in his testimony at a commission of inquiry into corruption in South Africa. "It should be a source of shame for the international community and these banks and professional enablers that they have facilitated this," he was quoted by AFP news agency as saying. "Some of these corporations are based in New York, London, Hong Kong and Shanghai," he added. Lord Hain was referring to alleged corruption involving the Indian-born Gupta family, which is accused of using its close relationship with Zuma to win government contracts and to influence ministerial appointments. All the accused deny any wrongdoing. South Africa's Deputy Chief Justice Ray Zondo is chairing the inquiry in the main city Johannesburg. Â
