The national, provincial and district leadership on Monday toured the venue and agreed to bring umbrellas for those who will attend the convention. President Mnangagwa, who is the revolutionary party’s First Secretary, will be the guest of honour. He will address the youths on various issues, including economic challenges and party programmes ahead of the forthcoming Zanu-PF 18th National People’s Conference set for Goromonzi next month. “Notice is hereby given of the Zanu-PF National Youth Convention which shall be held on November 27, 2019, in Kadoma, Mashonaland West Province, where Zanu-PF First Secretary and President Mnangagwa shall be the guest of honour”, Zanu-PF Youth League national commissar Godfrey Tsenengamu said. “The gathering provides youths with an opportunity to interact with the President and share ideas on how Zimbabwe can be developed. This interaction also provides an opportunity for youths to appreciate and exploit economic opportunities at their disposal and is a chance not to be missed.” Tsenengamu also told The Herald that each province was expected to hold preparatory meetings ahead of the convention. He called on party leaders in the country’s 10 provinces and National Assembly representatives to ensure youths in their respective areas attend the event to make it a resounding success. “We are also appealing to the main leadership of the party across the provinces to support and help the youths in making this event a success. We are also expecting students from all tertiary institutions to attend the convention and are appealing to the authorities to help the students in travelling to Kadoma,” he said. --Herald--
