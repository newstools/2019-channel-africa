Eight teams will compete from October 18-23 to progress to the Super 12s. Sri Lanka, Papua New Guinea, Ireland and Oman are in Group A, while Bangladesh, Netherlands, Namibia and Scotland are in Group B. The top two countries in each group will advance to the Super 12s. The Proteas, who are ranked fourth in T20 cricket, are in Group 2 in the Super 12s alongside India, England, Afghanistan and the pending two qualifiers. South Africa will play their first game on October 24 against India in Perth, then they'll face England (October 30), Afghanistan (November 1) followed by the two qualifiers. Proteas skipper, Faf du Plessis, has made it public that next year's T20 tournament will be his last before retiring from the game. South Africa will be hoping to improve after this year's horrid Cricket World Cup campaign which saw the side only registering three wins in their nine matches.
