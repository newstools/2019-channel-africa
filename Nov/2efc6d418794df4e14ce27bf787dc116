Fleetwood started the final round six shots off the lead but carded a seven-under 65 to finish on 12 under par, which Swede Kinhult matched with a 68. The Englishman, who had three eagles during his round, then made a brilliant par on the first extra hole to win. It was the 28-year-old's first victory since January 2018 and moved him up to second in the Race to Dubai. That last victory came as he defended the Abu Dhabi Invitational in January 2018. Since then, Fleetwood has had three runners-up finishes, including at the 2018 US Open to Brooks Koepka, and at this year's Open to Shane Lowry at Royal Portrush. "It's really, really cool when you win a tournament," he told Sky Sports. "And it's great for the people who go on the journey with you." Fleetwood's 65 was three shots better than anyone else on Sunday and in the play-off he produced a magnificent up-and-down to ensure his par beat Kinhult's bogey to take home the largest monetary prize on the European Tour, $2.5 million. He is now second behind Austria's Bernd Wiesberger in the Race to Dubai standings, with only one event to go, the DP World Tour Championship in Dubai. The Ryder Cup player is chasing his second victory in that, having won it in 2017. "It's an absolute privilege to have a chance of winning the Race to Dubai," added Fleetwood. "It's one of the things I'm most proud of in my career. I will start thinking about next week down the line. But I'm happy for the challenge. I may play terribly but I feel very ready." The tournament winner in Dubai next Sunday will receive $3 million (Â£2.32m), and the overall winner of the Race to Dubai will get an extra $2 million from a bonus pool of $5 million, which will be shared out between the top five in the final standings.
