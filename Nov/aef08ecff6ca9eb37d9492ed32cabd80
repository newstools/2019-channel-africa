Gavin Hunt says he may have to leave out some of his top players when they travel to Mali in the Confederation Cup next weekend, to avoid damaging their chances in the PSL. The fixture pressure increased when the Confederation of African Football compressed the continental schedule to make way for the African Nations Championship in April. "Well it's a nightmare for us because we're already four league games behind everybody in our league and with the three games changed in January we're going to 7 games behind," Hunt told the BBC World Service. "I don't know when we're going to catch these games up. So the domestic league has taken a bit of a battering at the moment." The congestion means that Hunt is thinking of splitting up his squad so they can try and compete on both fronts. Wits begin their Confederation Cup Group C campaign at home to visiting Horoya of Guinea on Sunday and then face a long trek to Mali to play Djoliba.
