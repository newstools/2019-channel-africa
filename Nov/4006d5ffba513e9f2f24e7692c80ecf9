England were tipped as favourites after beating New Zealand 19-7 in the semi-finals, but were upstaged 32-12 by a determined Springbok outfit in the final. Venter, a World Cup winner with the Boks in 1995, shared his views on the final via a column for New Zealandâ€™s Stuff.co.nz website. Venter added that England went into the contest with the wrong plan. England impressed with their ball-in-hand approach against the All Blacks but it didn't work against staunch Springbok defensive system that leaked only four tries the entire tournament. "England literally held out a red flag to the bull and said, 'Here we are, tackle us!' And that is what South Africa did. The fact is that the South African forward unity beat the English pack. For me, that is 100% where the World Cup was won."
