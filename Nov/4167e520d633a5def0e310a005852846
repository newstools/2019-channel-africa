Addressing youths at the 2019 National Youth Convention here yesterday, the President said maize-meal and rice were basic commodities and removing the subsidy would affect many people. “I want to say there are challenges that we are facing as a result of the austerity measures that we have already announced that we have eased in the (2020) Budget because we have achieved what we wanted,” he said. “We are now focusing on production, employment creation and youth empowerment. We must create safety nets to help our people. Two days ago I heard that the subsidy on mealie-meal and rice was removed. No. “I want to say this here, the issue of mealie-meal affects a lot of people and we cannot remove the subsidy. So I am restoring it so that the price of mealie-meal is also reduced. They are going to publish tomorrow that what we had done, we had not consulted the President.” He said basic goods must be cheap so that everyone can afford them.
“We have a cheap food policy that we are creating to ensure that basic foods are affordable,” he said.
In his 2020 National Budget, Finance and Economic Development Minister Mthuli Ncube said subsidies on roller meal, standard loaves of bread and cooking oil would remain. But he was moving from the more general subsidy of offering manufacturers cheap foreign exchange, which distorted markets and saw products used by the rich being subsidised as well as those used by most people, to direct subsidies on the most critical products paid to manufacturers. On the introduction of the local currency, President Mnangagwa said no country in the world would succeed without its currency. --Herald--
