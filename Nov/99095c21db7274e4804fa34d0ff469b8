The 25-year-old completed his hat-trick before half-time and added another five after the break with his final goal coming in injury time at the end of the match. His incredible feat took him to 27 goals in his 30 games for the club this season and help his side win the J2 League and promotion back to the top-flight just a season after being relegated. "What a way to end the season. Scoring 8 goals is more than I could ever imagine but by God's grace it was possible," Olunga posted on social media on Sunday. "I want to thank everyone who supported me throughout the campaign. Until next season. Gracias. God above all." Olunga scored for Kenya in their 1-1 draw with Egypt in a 2021 Africa Cup of Nations qualifier on 14 November. He also scored two of Kenya's three goals at the 2019 Nations Cup finals in Egypt. --BBC--
