The order was given amid concerns over fuel smuggling. Â The move comes after Nigeria closed all of its land borders two months ago in a bid to tackle smuggling. Bustling borders have since come to a standstill and earlier this week President Muhammadu Buhari approved their continued closure until 31 January 2020. The action was sparked largely by people smuggling rice into the country from neighbouring Benin. --BBC--
