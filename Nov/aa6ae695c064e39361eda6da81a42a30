Marking 300 years since the first African was sold in a slave market in America, Ghana, a major hub during the transatlantic slave trade, declared 2019 the year of return for people in the diaspora. At the ceremony on Wednesday evening, President Nana Akufo-Addo told the new citizens: "You have the responsibility of preserving and promoting the image of a country whose reputation, amongst the comity of nations, is, today, high." He said that development in the country was not a matter of relying on external assistance, which "is a mind-set that I wish us to discard, a mind-set of dependency and living on handouts".  --AfricaNews--
