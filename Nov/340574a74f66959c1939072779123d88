The 95-year-old former leader is now to recuperate at home, his spokesperson added. Moi was Kenya's longest-serving president, in office for 24 years from 1978 to 2002. He ruled the country with an iron fist and was accused of human rights abuses. Under international pressure, he allowed multi-party elections in 1992, which were marred by widespread violence and allegations of rigging. Earlier this year, Â a court ordered Moi $10.5 million in compensation to a widow for illegally seizing her land. --BBC--
