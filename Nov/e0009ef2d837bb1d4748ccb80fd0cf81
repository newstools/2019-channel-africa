South Africa scored on the stroke of half-time through eventual Man of the Match Leboang Phiri with an unstoppable strike with his weaker left foot. Ntseki said his players did what they needed to do to get the desired result and also get Bafana Bafana back on track in their qualifying campaign. "It was a very difficult match," Ntseki said. "In terms of our traveling schedule which made this fixture difficult. "In terms of the game we wanted to start on the front foot but unfortunately we missed too many chances and we ended up becoming a bit anxious. "On the balance of play I think the players did very well in terms of how they expressed themselves within our tactical plan but I think we started the second-half a bit slow," he added. "The last 25 minutes of the second-half you could see that our legs were tiring a bit and that's why we tried to make more attacking substitutions which nearly came off. The win is important for us as we're still fighting to qualify and hopefully everything will work out well for us." The 2021 AFCON qualifying campaign, set to be hosted by Cameroon, takes a nine-month break and will resume in September 2020.
