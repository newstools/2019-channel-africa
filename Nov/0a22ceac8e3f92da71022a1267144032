The Gambia, which has a largely Muslim population - is acting on behalf of the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation. Human Rights Watch says it is striking and welcome that The Gambia has taken the lead on the Rohingyas as the West African country has recently emerged from decades of brutal dictatorship. It says the court could help stop the worst on-going abuses against the Rohingya in Myanmar. A similar case brought in 1993 led to the ICJ finding Serbia had violated its duty to prevent and punish genocide in Bosnia-Herzegovina. --BBC--
