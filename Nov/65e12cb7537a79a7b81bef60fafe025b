The draft bill will now be debated in parliament. Last month 86 people were killed in ethnic conflicts which are believed to have been fuelled in part by divisive, inflammatory videos shared on social media. The Ethiopian government says it doesn't currently have the legal framework to deal with the issue. Some activists are concerned that if the draft bill becomes law it could be used to curb media freedom. --BBC--
