The department is hosting a two-day summit as part of Global Entrepreneurship Week in Polokwane, Limpopo. Countries throughout the world are observing the importance of promoting entrepreneurship as one of the key economic drivers. One of the goals of the Global Entrepreneurship Week is to create conditions for small businesses to thrive and to grow economies through entrepreneurship. In South Africa, only 15% of new companies become successful. The acting Director-General of the Small Business Development Department, Mzoxolo Maki, says government also wants to develop innovators. “GEW is basically a global celebration of innovators and SMMEs who launch startups and bring ideas to live and drive economic growth, so about 173 countries worldwide participate. South Africa is very keen as a member of the world, that is keen to develop entrepreneurs and SMMEs. We are then part of that movement.” Maki says $7 million has been set aside to help small businesses survive. He says the department has not been able to reach all entrepreneurs, particularly those in far-flung rural areas. “The GEW report says that South Africa does not fare very well in the entrepreneurship standing so responding to that the Department of Small Business Development has developed a program called the small business and innovation fund, mainly to support entrepreneurs and businesses in the ideation, proof of concept, start-up and scale-up face of the business cycle. This was our sharp response to the report that shows that we are not doing so well.”
