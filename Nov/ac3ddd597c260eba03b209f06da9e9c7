Incumbent President Filipe Nyusi and his party Frelimo won the 15 October election. The written judgement, which the news agency Reuters said was posted on the Constitutional Council's website earlier this week, said that there was not sufficient evidence of electoral fraud. Renamo leader Ossufo Momade said the annulment could result in violence. "If one wants to save Mozambique, the election must be annulled," Reuters quoted him as saying on broadcaster STV. The election has been seen as a test of a peace deal signed in August between the two parties, which fought a bitter 1975-1991 civil war, with renewed hostilities from 2013-16. --BBC--
