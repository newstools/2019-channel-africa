Hlatshwayo had grown accustomed to partnering his Bidvest Wits team-mate in the heart of the Bafana Bafana defence, but fixture congestion seemed to convince Ntseki to bring in Kaizer Chiefs stalwart Mathoho for the clash with Sudan on Sunday. In the end, the decision seemed to be the correct one as South Africa kept a clean sheet and beat the Falcons of Jediane 1-0 at Orlando Stadium. "For sure, everyone is important in the team, said Hlatshwayo as quoted by "Whether I'm playing or not, or Buhle is not around; Thami is not around, as long as (the team does well). "It's a country, it's not a football club like Bidvest Wits, but we're happy for 'Tower' to have come in, even though the coach didn't really explain why he took Buhle out. But, like I said, it's a country and everyone put their hands up (to get a place in the team)."
