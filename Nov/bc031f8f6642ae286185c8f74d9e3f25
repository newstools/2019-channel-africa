He advised a group of business executives on a tour of Mozambique organised by the department of trade, industry and competition to take a "360-degree view" of the opportunities in Mozambique instead of narrowly training their sights on the gas mega-projects that have attracted global attention. “Mozambique is going through a very momentous period both politically and economically.  The signing of the cessation of military hostilities and peace agreements in August, the general elections in October, and the amendment of the constitution were a watershed in the history of the country," Mpahlwa said. "These gave effect to a new political dispensation and placed the country in a good position to move forward politically. What is important to you to take into consideration is that this country is on an upward economic development path that is teeming with countless opportunities to explore." Many sectors of the economy such as agro-processing, the built environment, steel and transport would benefit from investments in the gas sector, Mpahlwa said. "Many inputs will be required for the projects. As business people, you need to position yourself to benefit from the secondary level of the gas projects," he said. "You need to take a 360-degree view of the wide spectrum of these opportunities and identify Mozambican companies and businesspeople that you can establish partnerships and joint ventures with." He told the business delegation that the Mozambican government had embarked on a major drive to electrify the county in order to increase access to electricity from about 30 % of the population to 60 %. --IOL--
