Ambassador Thomas Hushek will return for consultations “as part of the re-evaluation of the US relationship with the Government of South Sudan given the latest developments,” the department said in a statement. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo tweeted that Washington would “work with the region to support efforts to achieve peace and a successful political transition in South Sudan.” South Sudan’s ministry of foreign affairs said it was still engaging with the US. “Our position is still the same. We are still engaging with them and we have a good relationship,” spokesperson Mawien Makol told Reuters. He said differences over the extension of time to form a unity government “should not break our relations. The extension is meant to fully implement the peace agreement.” After a devastating five-year civil war, South Sudanese President Salva Kiir and opposition leader Riek Machar signed a peace deal in September 2018, under pressure from the United Nations, the US and regional governments. On November 7, they agreed to give themselves 100 days more beyond a November 12 deadline to form the unity government, and Washington said it was “gravely disappointed”. The conflict began after Kiir sacked Machar as Vice President. It killed an estimated 400 000 people, triggered a famine and created Africa’s biggest refugee crisis since the 1994 genocide in Rwanda.
