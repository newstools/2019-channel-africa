Manyama is a replacement for Mamelodi Sundowns winger Themba Zwane, who has been side-lined by injury. Manyama has been in good form for Chiefs this season, but the loss of Zwane is a blow for Coach Molefi Ntseki. Manyama won the last of his 16 caps two years ago as Bafana Bafana were bundled out of the World Cup qualifiers by Senegal. Bafana played Ghana in Cape Coast on Thursday, before dashing home for a meeting with Sudan on Sunday afternoon.  --AllAfrica--
