Two students were killed and at least a dozen others injured when chaos erupted at Woldia University in the Amhara region of northern Ethiopia. The head of security for the region, Hailemariam Ambaye, told the BBC that police are searching for more suspects in an on-going investigation. Authorities have not commented on the reason behind the deadly clash. However, local media report that the unrest started as a disagreement between two groups of students over a football game result which then quickly escalated. Hailemariam said the local mayor and residents have held discussions with the students and the situation is now under control. However, one student who spoke to the BBC said he and his friends fear for their lives and want to go home. --BBC--
