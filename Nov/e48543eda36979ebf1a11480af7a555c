Tshisekedi, who is on a three-day visit to Uganda during which he will attend the first ever Uganda-Congo Trade Forum, said he was backing Museveni’s vision to have an integrated Africa. The two leaders jointly addressed a press conference in Kampala over the weekend where they revealed plans to construct roads linking the two countries to enable the transportation of goods across the border. “One road we want to work on is from Goli to Mahagi, Bunia, that’s one road. Then the other road would be from Mpondwe to Beni and the other from Bunagana to Rutshuru to Goma,” said Museveni. Ministers from the two countries also signed memorandums of understanding on security, infrastructure, transport and tourism. The border region between Uganda and the Democratic Republic of Congo has seen years of violence, with militia groups from both countries based in the area.

--BBC-- .@KagutaMuseveni: We are going to improve road infrastructure including the Mpondwe-Beni, Goli-Bunia, Bunagana-Rutshuru-Goma roads and the bridge across river Semuliki to Bunya. These will improve trade, social issues and will guarantee security. ð¨ð©ðºð¬#UGDRC #StateVisit pic.twitter.com/j5GvAnqBvw
