The company, a poultry producer which also makes animal feed, said headline earnings per share (HEPS) for the full year ended September 30 stood at R16.59 ($1.12), a 55% fall from the R36.91 ($2.44) reported a year earlier. Astral Foods had already flagged that it expected a drop of between 50% and 60% in HEPS, the main profit measure in South Africa, in a profit warning. In its outlook, the firm listed a number of factors which are likely to impact its business negatively, including a weak economy, high raw material prices and strong levels of poultry imports from Brazil and the United States. “Astral’s view on the near-term prospects can be regarded as a mixed bag,” it said, adding other changes, such as the expansion of its poultry production capacity, would have a positive effect. While sales were up in its poultry division, expenses, mainly in the form of a 7.7% increase in the price of feed which represents the main cost per chicken, helped drag operating profits down by 74.5% to R371 million ($25 million). Astral’s feed division however benefited from a rise in raw material prices, boosting revenues by 6.1% despite falling volumes and contributing to a 7.2% rise in operating profit. Profits in its division covering the rest of the continent fell by over 30%, as feed costs rocketed in Zambia due to a drought and crop failure. Astral also took a provision for taxes owed by the Mozambican government which it does not expect to recover. It gave no further details. At 0906 GMT Astral’s share price had gained 0.55% to R172.95 ($11.6 million). --Reuters--
