On Friday, Luyanda Botha pleaded guilty to the charges and entered into a sentencing agreement in the Western Cape High Court. The 19-year old student was bludgeoned to death with a metal scale at a post office where she had gone to collect a parcel. Botha will serve a life sentence for murder, two life sentences on both counts of rape, and five years for defeating the ends of justice. The five-year sentence will run along with the other sentences. Botha will not be eligible for parole for 25 years. There were brief cheers and applause from the courtroom as the sentence was being handed down. Mrwetyana’s murder was not only brutal but it was calculated. The court heard that after killing her Botha left the victim's body in a safe overnight before taking her to field in Lingelethu West the next day where he doused her body with petrol and set it alight, in a bid to get rid of the evidence. He had first met the student just two weeks earlier when she had gone to the post office to inquire about a parcel she was expecting. The young woman’s death caused nationwide outrage and prompted protests in various cities, and a social media campaign called #AmINext and #IAmNene. --BBC--
