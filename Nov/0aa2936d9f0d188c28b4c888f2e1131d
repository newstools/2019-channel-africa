Dr Carolin Braun, from Germany, moved to Botswana in February for two years to assist in football development, to educate coaches, identify talent and work with women's football, under the German Olympic Sports Confederation. But new Zebras coach Adel Amrouche has decided to also use her in the national team coaching set-up as his assistant coach, and she started with games against Zimbabwe and Algeria. Braun is highly-qualified, with a PhD in sports science and a Uefa A Coaching Licence, and she is pleased to have her new duty with the national team. "Of course for the world it's still something new, and at first probably everyone is looking and asking, 'is this really a woman', but for me it's the same, it's football and I love working with the women as well as working with the men," Dr Braun told BBC Sport. "It's one game and it's even better if we get rid of any kind of thinking that it's not for girls. "I don't know if any other national team has a female assistant coach, so it's a good sign and an important sign nowadays to show that it's not a problem at all." With her help Botswana drew 0-0 away in neighbouring Zimbabwe and the lost narrowly 1-0 to African champions Algeria in Gaborone. --BBC--
