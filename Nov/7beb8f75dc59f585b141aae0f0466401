This comes after 24 Ugandans working in Rwanda were also expelled over the weekend, according to local leaders in Kisoro district. The expulsions come amid tensions between the two east African countries that have festered since Rwanda closed the main common border post in February. The Rwandans, arrested on Monday, were deported on Tuesday through Kyanika border post shortly after they appeared before a magistrate’s court and pleaded guilty to illegal entry into Uganda. Also deported alongside them were three Congolese nationals. Rwandan media however reported that the number of its nationals arrested could be higher. Since Rwanda closed its border in February over concerns that Uganda was supporting rebels opposed to President Paul Kagame’s government, it has discouraged its citizens from travelling to Uganda. Uganda in turn accuses its neighbour of infiltrating its intelligence services. The two countries are yet to make any headway to resolve the dispute despite an agreement signed in talks brokered by the presidents of Angola and the Democratic Republic of Congo in August.
