The benchmark Nikkei average was virtually flat at 23 408.04 in late-morning trade but was on track to post a 2.1% rise for the month. For the week, it was on track to log a 1.2% gain, to mark its first weekly rise in three weeks. US' S&P 500 mini futures were last down 0.2%. New York markets were shut on Thursday for Thanksgiving holiday and with many investors kept to the sidelines on Friday, waiting to see how US markets perceive the latest clash between Washington and Beijing over Hong Kong. China warned the United States on Thursday it would take “firm counter measures” in response to US legislation backing anti-government protesters in Hong Kong. “The question is what real actions Beijing will take. The working assumption for most investors is that this will not derail the trade talks, given China is suffering from an economic slowdown,” said Norihiro Fujito, Chief Investment Strategist at Mitsubishi UFJ Morgan Stanley Securities.
