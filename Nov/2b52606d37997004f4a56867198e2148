That fact alone may be enough to ensure a turnout at least bordering on healthy, something that could barely be considered a feature of the opening round of matches in the much-debated, currently money-losing Twenty20 tournament, at SuperSport Park when the Tshwane Spartans team he represents entertains the Nelson Mandela Bay Giants (17:30, live on SABC3). The supposedly international-themed event, currently in its second edition, is already labouring in 2019 through the absence of the majority of known global drawcards in the format, and not helped by tottering South African cricket itself boasting a smaller crop of true superstars possibly than at any prior time in its post-isolation history. That situation would be so different, of course, if the flamboyant, innovative stroke-player who is De Villiers continued to strut his stuff in the Proteas’ various-format shirts. But the now 35-year-old hasn’t done that since his final stepdown from international activity in the March 2018, series-deciding fourth and final Test against Australia at the Wanderers, where he fittingly contributed 69 in the first innings. Now, after a glittering Proteas career comprising 420 matches across three formats and 20,014 runs, he is simply an “enjoy him when you can” sort of figure in the more cheap-thrills-like but lucratively-paid landscape of the travelling T20 franchise circuit. But his fan club remains an extended one and more especially in the environs of Centurion, scene of Wednesday’s clash, where his first-class career began back in October 2003.
