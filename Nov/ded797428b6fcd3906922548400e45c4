The 28-year-old made the announcement via social media this week, with a short message on Instagram while on holiday in the United States of America. Hamdallah failed to give an explanation for his premature retirement from international football, but the announcement follows his omission from the squad for upcoming 2021 Africa Cup of Nations (Afcon) qualifiers this month. Atlas Lions head coach, Vahid Halilhodzic, has not included the forward in any of his squads since taking over the reins from Herve Renard in August, with Hamdallahâ€™s last appearance for the national team coming back in June. He duly missed out on selection for the 2019 Africa Cup of Nations and hangs up his international boots having scored seven goals in 16 appearances. Hamdallah, who scored an incredible 49 goals across all competitions for Al-Nassr last season, has already scored seven in eight Saudi Arabia top-flight games this campaign. --AllAfrica--
