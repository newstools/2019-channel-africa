Colonel Frederic Barbry also told French television station, BFM TV, that the bodies of the 13 dead French soldiers would soon be repatriated to France. The soldiers died in Mali on Nov. 25, when their helicopters collided as they hunted in the dark for Islamist militants. It was the biggest loss of French troops in a single day since an attack in Beirut 36 years ago when 58 soldiers died.
