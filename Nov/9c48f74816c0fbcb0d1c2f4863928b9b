Max Verstappen won the penultimate race of the season from pole to flag and Red Bull only missed out on a second podium spot after Alex Albon was taken out by Lewis Hamilton during the closing stages. Worryingly for Bottas and company is the fact that Red Bull are now "better than Mercedes" on the straights. "We knew they would be strong, but I think they were even stronger than we expected," the Finn told Racefans.net. "Especially in a straight line. "They have a good car in the corners now but in a straight line, they are better than us now. It used to be pretty similar to us." Mercedes had a big advantage over the rest of the field at the start of the year, but Ferrari eventually narrowed the gap and now Red Bull have also caught up.
