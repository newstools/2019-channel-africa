The incorrect story that was reported in the southern African press was that a woman in South Africa had come into contact with another woman from the Democratic Republic of Congo and then crossed the border from South Africa into Lesotho. Lesotho's health ministry incorrectly told the press that a woman had been rushed to hospital after displaying symptoms of the virus and had been tested positive for Ebola. But the National Institute for Communicable Diseases clarified that it was actually just an exercise and no-one had tested positive for Ebola. It went on to say that the scenario in the exercise is unlikely to happen.
Multiple news sites said Lesotho's Health Minister Nkaku Kabi had incorrectly confirmed the case. He is expected to talk later today at a press conference.
--BBC-- This was the first small scale field simulation exercise to test preparedness. The @nicd_sa BSL4 Lab has not been requested to test suspected Ebola cases for any neighbouring countries. As such, we have not had a positive Ebola case. #EbolaInLesotho https://t.co/pSfVv8uko8
