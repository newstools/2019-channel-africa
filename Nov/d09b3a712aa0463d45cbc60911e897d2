Ministry of Commerce, Industry and Trade Communications Officer, Thabile Mdluli, explained that the MoU was a milestone that demonstrated intentions to strengthen bilateral business and trade relations between the business communities of the Kingdom of Eswatini and Taiwan.

She said this would further create forums to discuss and explore business opportunities that exist between the two countries. “The MoU further seeks to operationalise the Economic Co-operation Agreement (ECA) which the Kingdom signed with Taiwan in 2018 and is implemented through government agencies such as EIPA in Eswatini as well as BOFT and Taiwan Trade (TAITRA) in Taiwan,” said Mdluli. It was reported that representing the kingdom during the signing ceremony, which took place in Taipei on Tuesday, was Chief Executive Officer of Eswatini Investment Promotion Authority (EIPA), Sibani Mngomezulu, while representing BOFT was Jen-Ni Yang, the Director General. It was stated that also in attendance was Eswatini’s Ambassador to Taiwan Thamie Dlamini; the Vice Secretary of Import and Export Association of Taipei, Vincent Tsai, President of Taiwan Africa Business Association Jeff Sun as well as Xris Lin, the Commissioner of Taiwan External Trade Development Council. Mdluli said there had been a lot of excitement around the signing of the MoU. As a result, she announced that the President of Taiwan Africa Business Association would be leading 12 Taiwanese business delegates to the country on November 17, 2019. The delegates operate in various economic sectors, among food processing; medicine; renewable energy (solar); and automobile components and parts. It was stated that some of the delegates already had the opportunity to meet with Prime Minister, Ambrose Mandvulo Dlamini, during his recent visit to Taiwan. Mdluli said EIPA would be co-ordinating business to business meetings with local businesses during their stay in Eswatini. --TimesOfSwaziland--
