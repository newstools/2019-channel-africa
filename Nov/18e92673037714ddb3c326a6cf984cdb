Boeing's chairperson David Calhoun said Mr Muilenburg had made the suggestion. Muilenburg recently faced US lawmakers who accused he firm of building “flying coffins” and engaging in a "pattern of deliberate concealment". But Calhoun said Muilenburg "has done everything right". Calhoun, who took over as chairman after Muilenburg was stripped of the role last month, told CNBC that the chief executive retained the confidence of Boeing's board. For 2018, Muilenburg's pay included a $13 million bonus on top of his $1.7 million salary. His total pay package rose 27% from 2017. Last October, a Boeing 737 Max operated by Lion Air crashed, killing all 189 people on board. Five months later an Ethiopian Airlines plane crashed, killing 157 people, after which the entire 737 Max fleet was grounded. At last week's hearing with US senators, families of people who died in the crash told the BBC that they felt Muilenburg was evasive and should resign. "I want him to say unequivocally that he takes responsibility for the deaths of 346 people because the crashes were preventable," said Paul Njoroge, who lost five family members in the Ethiopian Airlines crash. Adnaan Stumo, whose sister Samya died in the Ethiopian Airlines crash, said Muilenburg should step down "and go to jail". Speaking to CNBC on Tuesday, Calhoun said that the company did not have any plans to change the name of the 737 Max. --BBC--
