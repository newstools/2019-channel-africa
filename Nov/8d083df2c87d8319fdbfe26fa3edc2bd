The Brazilian playmaker, who is Chelsea's third longest serving player, is out of contract at the end of the season and will be able to walk away on a free transfer unless the Blues can get him tied down to a new deal. Chelsea boss Frank Lampard has expressed a desire to secure the player's future, but as things stand there is no sign of him putting pen-to-paper, and that could open the door for rival clubs to swoop in. Both Barca and Juve are said to be keeping an eye on developments as they could open talks with Willian's representatives in January with a view to hammering out a pre-contract agreement for the summer. Willian is sure to be tempted by the prospect of a move to either club. At the age of 31, it could be his last chance for one final big move and the kind of deal on offer with Juventus or Barcelona is likely to be huge. Chelsea would have to go some way to match it, but even then the prospect of playing in La Liga or Serie A could be too tempting for him to turn down. Juventus in particular have made a habit of snapping up players from the English Premier League on free transfers, with Aaron Ramsey the latest example after he swapped Arsenal for Turin. Lampard is likely to be key to the player's decision and he will be working hard to try and convince him to stay where he is for now. The Chelsea boss has spoken openly about how important Willian is to the future of the club and how he wants him on board. If Willian feels wanted, he could stay. However, Lampard has also admitted he has nothing to do with the money side of things so it could come down to the offers on the table from all three clubs. --news24--
