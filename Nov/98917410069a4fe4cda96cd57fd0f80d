Botomani made the remarks during the farewell ceremony of the Seeds for the Future 2019 Children at Bingu International Convention Centre on Thursday. The minister noted that Rwanda has developed its Information Communications Technology base to the extent of having a factory where smartphones are manufactured. Botomani said as a Minister responsible for ICT development in the country he wants to see the same thing happening here in Malawi. “It is my wish that what our friends in Rwanda are doing, we should also be able to do it here,” said Botomani. He then expressed hope that Malawi soon will have a company that will establish itself to manufacture smart gadgets. “As Government we welcome such Foreign Direct Investment initiatives because apart from boosting our economy and increasing forex, they also provide employment for our youth,” he said. The farewell ceremony was organized to see off youth from different ICT training institutions across the country who are travelling to Beijing City in China. --MalawiTimes--
