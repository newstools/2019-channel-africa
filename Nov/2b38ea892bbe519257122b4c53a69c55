In its latest report, the rights group documented more than 100 cases of activists and journalists who have been detained since President Abdul Fattah al-Sisi came to power five years ago. The group said the state used hand-picked judges during trials and abused its legal powers to stifle political dissent. Nationwide protests were sparked in 2014 after Sisi led the military removal of the country's first democratically elected president, Mohammed Morsi. --BBC--
