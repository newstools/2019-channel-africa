The suspects were reportedly hired from secondary schools in the central districts of Buikwe and Mukono to sit exams for pupils at Sese Bugolo primary school. The area's Principal Education Officer, Hassan Nkuntu, said on Tuesday that they discovered the impostors after noticing their photo identification did not match the candidates' “The suspects were spotted by one of the scouts deployed to oversee the ongoing examination process at school. We discovered that their photos were not matching with the original photos that Uganda National Examinations Board provided,” he said. The Regional Police Spokesperson, Hellen Butoto, said they will ask the school's administration to explain the incident. --BBC-- Police in Buikwe District have arrested 12 people reportedly hired to write Primary Leaving Examinations (PLE) for some candidates https://t.co/JhLesJbK8c #MonitorUpdates pic.twitter.com/m3mtyoUVx3
