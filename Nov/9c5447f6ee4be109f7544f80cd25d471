Jugnauth's Militant Socialist Movement (MSM) won 35 out of the 62 available seats, the election commission said. Its closest rivals, the Labour Party, claimed 15 seats. The 57 year old took over as prime minister two years ago, following the resignation of his father, Sir Anerood, who led six governments in Mauritius between 1982 and 2017. Jugnauth's opponents have campaigned against what they called the nepotism of his succession. --BBC--
