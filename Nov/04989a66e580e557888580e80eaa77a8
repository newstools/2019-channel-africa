MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan .MIAPJ0000PUS rose 0.5% to a one-week high. Australian shares were up 0.9%, while Japan's Nikkei stock index. Shares in the region extended gains on Tuesday after Beijing said Liu He, China’s Vice premier and chief trade negotiator, held a call with his US counterparts and that both sides reached consensus on solving relevant problems. That followed positive headlines out of China and the United States on Monday, which had helped bolster confidence. The yen fell to a two-week low versus the dollar, while the Swiss franc traded near a six-week low against the greenback as the optimistic tone sapped demand for safe-haven currencies. Oil prices erased early losses to edge higher amid cautious optimism about progress toward relieving one of the biggest risks to the global economic outlook. “The broad trend is the markets are looking for a deal because trade has been the biggest factor weighing on global growth and holding back confidence,” said Shane Oliver, head of investment strategy and chief economist at AMP Capital Investors in Sydney.
