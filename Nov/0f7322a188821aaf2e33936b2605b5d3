The postponement comes a week before they are due to form a coalition government on 12 November following a peace deal. Although no reason was given for the postponement, International Crisis Group (ICR) warned in a report on Monday that the two warring parties are not ready to work together. It predicted that President Salva Kiir is "hinting at" assembling a government without opposition leader Riek Machar. If this prediction comes true, it goes against the power-sharing deal they agreed in August 2018 which said Machar would return to government as one of five vice-presidents. "South Sudan could slide back into war," ICR warned. Tens of thousands of people have been killed in the conflict which broke out in 2013 after a power struggle between Kiir and Machar. --BBC--
