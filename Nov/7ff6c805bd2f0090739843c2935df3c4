Meanwhile on Thursday humanitarian assistance group, Co-operating Partners urged Zambia to work towards obtaining an IMF programme. The group said it is ready to support Zambia in the endeavour, describing the recent visit of an IMF team to the country as a sign that government is determined to engage with the IMF.
