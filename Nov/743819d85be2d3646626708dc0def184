He made six straight pars in his first six holes, made a birdie on seven, a par on eight and another birdie to go out in 33. "I played well from the start and gave myself opportunities and the putts didn't drop," he said. "I had a good par-save on eight, and a nice birdie on nine. From there on, I got some better chances and some putts dropped. I'm really happy with a 65 and a birdie on the last." The homeward nine was a little bit more eventful for Besseling because after the par he made after the turn, he made a birdie on the 11th. A bogey on 13, his only drop on the day, took from the gains he’d made on the previous hole but he bounced back emphatically, birdieing the par-five 13th and the 14th before making an eagle on 15. A birdie on the final hole earned him an opening round of 65. "It's a great start for the season," Besseling said. "I'm very happy with my 65 today. I had it going nicely on the par-fives. I was able to get there in two with irons and converted the birdies, and an eagle on 15 really helped." He was among the many players who welcomed the history-making decision to play this tournament in shorts due to a scorching heatwave which has visited this part of the country. "Definitely a nice change. I mean, the first time ever on tour wearing shorts in a tournament round, and probably this is the place to do it." Tied for second is the trio of England's Garrick Porteous, Spain’s Pablo Larrazabal and local man, Keith Horne, who all signed for 66s.
