The Standing Committee on Finance was this week briefed by organisations including Broad-Based Black Economic Empowerment Commission (B-BBEE), the Financial Sector Transformation Council (FSTC), Treasury and the South African Reserve Bank on transformation in the sector. The briefing comes after just days after President Cyril Ramaphosa met with the Black Business Council, where transformation was discussed. In the President's newsletter issued on Monday, he lamented the lack of transformation in the private sector given that top management positions in the sector are still dominated by white men. "Africans only make up 15% of top management, despite accounting for 79% of the economically active population," Ramaphosa said in his newsletter. Similarly, reports by both the B-BBEE Commission and the FSTC presented at the committee meeting show that there has been regression in transformation targets in the financial sector. The B-BBEE Commission, which is mandated to receive and initiate investigations into non-compliance with the country's transformation policy, also keeps a register of B-BBEE transactions and analyses transformation reports from Johannesburg Stock Exchange-listed companies, public entities and organs of state, said that so far this year 23 entities had submitted reports. The commission found that the level of black ownership in the financial sector had regressed from 38% first reported in 2016 to 31.79% reported in 2017 and 21.64% reported in 2018.Â 

The level of black people being in management control of entities has also been on a declining trend, from 57% reported in 2016 to 52.85% in 2017 and for 2018 declined further to 51.50%.
