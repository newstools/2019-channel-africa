Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, Head of the World Health Organisation (WHO), tweeted about the incidents in the Biakato Mines and Mangina response centres.

On Tuesday, the WHO said it was relocating 49 staff after crowds attacked a United Nations (UN) base in the town of Beni accusing UN forces of not protecting them from rebel attacks. Ebola responders have previously been targeted by militias and people who do not believe the fatal virus is real and also have deep suspicion about how the vaccine is administered. A few weeks ago a journalist who was raising awareness about Ebola in the north-eastern province of Ituri was killed and his house burnt down. DRC is experiencing the world's second-worst Ebola epidemic on record, which has killed more than 2 000 people and infected over 3 000. The outbreak is affecting North Kivu, South Kivu and Ituri provinces, which are already riven by violence perpetrated by militias operating there. In July, the WHO said the situation there was a "public health emergency of international concern".
