Analysts say interest rates are likely to drop from the current average of 18 % to at least 16.4 % in the coming months due to an accommodative monetary policy, improved economic performance as well as increasing competition in Rwandaâ€™s banking sector. In addition, the current low rate of the repo rate, the rate at which the central bank lends to commercial banks, may reduce appetite for commercial banks to invest in government securities which may force banks to issue more credit to private sector at favourable rates. In 2016, it stood at seven per cent, and the fact that it currently stands at five per cent shows the central banks willingness to stimulate growth in the private sector. Banking sector lending picked up in the first three quarters of this year due to increased demand for credit, with an increase in outstanding loans of 20.1 % (Year-on-Year), compared with a 7.2 % growth recorded end of September, 2018. In the first nine months of 2019, new authorised loans grew by 41.1 %, from 0.3 % in the same period of the previous year, mainly attributed to easy monetary conditions and improved economic conditions. --TheEastAfrican--
