The Englishman started the final day six shots off the lead. He carded a final round of seven-under-par 65 to finish tied on a 12-under total of 276 with Sweden’s Marcus Kinhult, who shot 68. He managed three eagles and four birdies in an impressive round. Fleetwood then made a par on the first extra hole to win $2.5 million, the biggest first prize in the history of the European Tour. The victory takes Fleetwood up to second on the Race to Dubai Rankings. He will be looking to be crowned Europe’s Number One for the second time in three seasons at next week’s season finale in Dubai. He says it would be incredible to win it again. Fleetwood’s fifth European Tour win is his first since January 2018. It was the culmination of a consistent run of form that has seen him make 41 consecutive cuts worldwide. He finished six shot behind in round one, five shots behind in round two and six shots behind in round three. He says he had the belief to win after managing an eagle on the ninth hole. South African Zander Lombard was fourth in round one, the leader in round two and three but fell by the wayside in the final round. He finished tied in eighth position signing off with six-under par total of 282. He was very disappointed. Lombard was making his debut at the Nedbank Golf Challenge. He was not sure what went wrong on the day but feels that he has made great strides in the last few months.
