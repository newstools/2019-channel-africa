Authorities say narcotics were seized during the Sunday night operation. Members of Uganda's LGBT community patronise at the bar which hosts a popular party on Sunday. Patrick Onyango, the spokesperson for the Kampala Metropolitan Police, says they were not aware of any LGBT patrons. The Ugandan government has denied that it plans to introduce new legislation targeting the LGBT community. Several members of parliament have said they will table a bill making homosexuality punishable by death. In October, 16 men were arrested over allegations of committing unnatural sex offences under the penal code.
