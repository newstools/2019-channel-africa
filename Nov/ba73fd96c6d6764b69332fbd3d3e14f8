They appear to be throwing wooden panels at each other. One video shows parliamentary papers strewn on the floor and spattered with blood. The trouble was sparked by a long-running dispute over regulations controlling the sale of the produce from the country's important wool and mohair industry. For decades, Lesotho's farmers sold the wool and mohair through a South African broker. But new regulations introduced last year forced them to used a broker based in Lesotho. This sparked big protests from the farmers and earlier this year a court said the new rules were illegal. Last month, a parliamentary report adopted by lawmakers said the regulations should be repealed, Bloomberg reported at the time. They gave the government seven days to come up with new regulations. But things came to a head on Thursday as opposition MPs ran out of patience and demanded that the minister responsible, Chalane Phori, appear before them. They began raising points of order saying that the sitting should not continue until Phori turns up, a witness, who wanted to remain anonymous, told the BBC. The speaker then suspended the session and that is when the fighting broke out. Oppositon and government MPs started throwing things at each other and one minister was hit on the head, the witness said. Another MP was also injured, he added.
