This was after various unions, including Solidarity, attended a consultation at the Commision for Conciliation, Mediation and Arbitration (CCMA) during the day in this regard. SAA recently announced a restructuring process which could put about 944 jobs at risk.

The National Union of Metalworkers of South Africa (Numsa) and the South African Cabin Crew Association (Sacca) secured a 5.9% wage increase from SAA last week after a week-long strike, which led to various flights being cancelled. The cash-strapped airline previously said the strike was costing it about $4 million a day. A task team, facilitated by the CCMA, must furthermore find the cost savings needed for the airline to make up the remaining 2.1% of the effective 8% wage increase for Numsa and Sacca members. SAA has cautioned that its ability to pay in terms of the agreement will be subject to availability of funding. The aim of Monday's meeting at the CCMA by the remaining unions represented at SAA was to establish whether the Section 189 retrenchment process in terms of labour law could continue in the light of a deal made by a bargaining unit consisting of Numsa and the Sacca. In terms of this deal, the bargaining unit's restructuring consultation has been deferred to January 31 next year. Numsa and Sacca did not negotiate about jobs at managerial level. One of the views argued on Monday was that the S189 process could not continue as the current notification letter, which had already been issued in terms thereof, included employees no longer involved in the process due to the Numsa and Sacca deferment agreement.

The CCMA, however, found on Monday that the process could continue at managerial level.
