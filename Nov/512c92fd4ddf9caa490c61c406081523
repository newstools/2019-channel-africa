But there’s one it shares with megacities around the world: a worsening plastic waste problem. The amount of plastic bottles used in Nigeria has doubled in just the past three years, to an estimated 150 000 metric tons annually, with half of them consumed in Lagos. Four-fifths of the containers are never reused or recycled, and during even a modest rain, the city’s streets can flood because litter, much of it plastic trash, blocks drainage lines. The concept of formal recycling isn’t widespread in Lagos. Until now the government hasn’t moved to allow drinks to be packaged in recycled material because of health concerns. Even bottles that don’t end up burned or blocking sewer grates, particularly bad environmental outcomes, are thrown in unsorted trash and eventually make their way to one of two landfills to be buried in a gooey mish-mash of solid waste. Thousands of scavengers live and work on the landfills, hunting for specific materials including PET, which only a handful of manufacturers there are willing to buy. --Bloomberg--
