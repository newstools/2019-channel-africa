MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan edged up a slight 0.04%, following a sharp 1.2% pullback on Monday. Japan’s Nikkei dithered either side of flat, while Shanghai blue chips eased 0.1%. E-Mini futures for the S&P 500 also dipped 0.1%, as did EUROSTOXX 50 futures. Caution ruled ahead of a speech by US President Donald Trump to the Economic Club of New York later in the day in case there was any new word on the Sino-US Phase one trade deal. Trump wrongfooted markets over the weekend when he said there had been incorrect reporting about US willingness to lift tariffs on China. On a more positive note, Politico reported Trump would announce this week that he is delaying a decision on whether to slap tariffs on imported European Union autos for another six months. Investors were anxious about the situation in Hong Kong after a violent escalation of protests knocked nearly 2% off Asia-exposed banks HSBC and StanChart. Riot police were deployed at metro stations across the territory and large queues were forming at railway platforms as commuters struggled to get to work.
