Lime electric scooters will launch in Cape Town, South Africa in early 2020, marking the company’s first micromobility deployment on the African continent. The initial fleet of scooters will be available at strategic, privately-owned locations throughout the city. "Cape Town is helping lead the way forward on technology and innovation in Africa, and we’re excited to be a part of that story," said Wayne Ting, Global Head of Operations and Strategy at Lime. Ting added, "Our mission is to improve urban living through sustainable, affordable transportation, and we’re looking forward to extending meaningful mobility access and reduced carbon emissions to South Africans living in and traveling to Cape Town". With the addition of Cape Town to its global ridership community, Lime will now offer micromobility services on six continents worldwide. --IOL--
