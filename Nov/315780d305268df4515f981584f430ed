The Scorpions suffered a 3-1 aggregate defeat to the Palancas Negras in the 2022 FIFA World Cup qualifiers in September, going down 2-1 in the Angolan capital as this week’s hosts booked their place in the next round. The two nations will thus be familiar with each other as Tom Saintfiet’s side eye an early upset in what will be a very tightly contested Group D, which also includes DRC and Gabon. Hamburg’s Bakery Jatta will miss the clash following his withdrawal from the Gambia squad while Mohammed Badamosi is nursing an injury and is a doubt for their midweek fixture. Palancas Negras suffered a group stage exit at the most recent Afcon tournament hosted in Egypt earlier this year, while Gambia have yet to qualify for Africa’s premier competition. Angola currently occupy 120th place in the latest FIFA World Rankings, while Gambia come in at 166th. --AllAfrica--
