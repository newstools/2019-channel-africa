Eight civilians are reported to have died in the attack, by the Allied Democratic Forces (ADF) militia. Dozens of people have been killed in the area since the Congolese army launched an operation against the ADF at the beginning of the month. Beni's residents have been protesting over the failure of the authorities and the United Nations mission (Monusco) to protect civilians. --BBC--
