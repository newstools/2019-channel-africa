Aisha Musa, a teacher and activist appointed to the 11 member Sovereign Council, told the BBC the civilian and military members of the body were all working hard together to bring peace. She said it had been a bit awkward at first for civilian members of the council to work together the military leaders, but she said now they were working hard together as a team. Even Lieutenant-General, Abdel Fattah Abdelrahman Burhan, who heads the council, called her "Aunt Aisha" as a mark of their respect and improved relations, she said. I donâ€™t find any difficulty in asking him about his family or how he is doing or why is he late, anything. And he would call me Aunt Aisha." She acknowledged being frustrated at the slow pace of change in the economic situation, and called for rules curbing the progress of women to be abolished. The Sovereign Council will govern for a transitional period that is due to end with elections in 2022. --BBC--
