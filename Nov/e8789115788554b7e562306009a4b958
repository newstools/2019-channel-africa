It is part of a commitment to return to its former West African colonies key items of their cultural heritage. The artefact originally belonged to the revered west African leader Omar Saidou Tall, who led an anti-colonial struggle against the French. French Prime Minister Edouard Philippe handed the sword to Senegal's President Macky Sall in a ceremony in Dakar. "This is an historic day," the Senegalese leader said. Some of Omar Saidou Tall's descendants were present at the ceremony.

Philippe said it was "the first step" in a project aimed at returning more Senegalese artefacts currently in French museums, which hold at least 90 000 artefacts from sub-Saharan Africa. In 2018 a group of experts commissioned by France's President Emmanuel Macron recommended that African treasures in French museums be returned to their countries of origin. Their official report states that most of the Africa collection in Paris' Quai Branly museum - approximately 46 000 pieces - was acquired with some degree of duress.Â
