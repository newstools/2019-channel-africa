Sileshi Bekele, Ethiopia's minister for water and irrigation, said Trump made the comments during US-mediated talks aimed at solving a diplomatic row between the three countries over the sharing of the River Nile's waters. During the meeting, the three sides agreed to hold further talks in the US, and to reach a final settlement by January 15. A joint statement issued on behalf of the three countries by the US Treasury Department did not mention any plans by the US president to open the dam. The $4 billion (Â£3 billion) dam, the structure of which is expected to be finished next year, is at the heart of Ethiopia's manufacturing and industrial dreams. When fully operational, it is expected to be able to generate a massive 6 000 megawatts of electricity. But Egypt fears the project will allow Ethiopia to control the flow of Africa's longest river.
