"I order 72 hours of national mourning, starting from 0000 GMT 8 November. During these 72 hours I call on every Burkinabe to meditate and examine themselves in order to reaffirm their faith in the unity, cohesion and peace of our country," Â Kabore said in an address to the nation aired on Thursday by state-run Radio-Television du Burkina TV. President Kabore also announced a plan to recruit volunteers to support the security forces.
