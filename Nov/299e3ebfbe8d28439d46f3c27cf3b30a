According to A Tanzania National Bureau of Statistics report released recently, the fast growth of the gross domestic product in the April-June 2019 period was due to improved performance of construction, mining and communications sectors. “The largest share to GDP in the second quarter of 2019 was from tertiary activities which accounted to 41.5 %, followed by primary activities by 32.9 % and secondary activities had the least share of 25.7 %, before adjustment for taxes,” the report said. Construction recorded the highest growth of 19.6 % followed by mining and quarrying (17.2 %) and information and communication (10.3 %), it said. The economy grew by 6.6 % in the first quarter of 2019 and government expects full-year GDP growth to expand by 7.1 % this year, up from 7 % last year. In the second quarter, construction recorded a double-digit growth rate, at 19.6 % compared with 5.2 % in the corresponding quarter of 2018. The growth was attributed to an increase in local production of construction materials like cement, iron and steel that are used in construction. The activities that followed were mining and quarrying at 17.2 % in the second quarter compared with a growth rate of 6.8 % in the similar quarter of 2018. Growth was mainly due to an increase in production of gold, coal, and diamond. --TheEastAfrican--
