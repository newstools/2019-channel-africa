A Rwandan government account has shared pictures of the group on Twitter. The refugees are mainly Eritrean and Somali nationals. The group was transported from Kigali airport to the Gashora transit centre, 40km east of the capital, where the other 189 refugees who arrived in September and October have been settled. The resettlement is part of an agreement between the Rwandan government, the United Nations refugee agency and the African Union. They agreed to resettle 500 out of more than 4 000 migrants being held in Libya after their illegal journeys to Europe were halted. --BBC--
