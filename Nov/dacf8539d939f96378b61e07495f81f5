Traore was rumoured to have committed his international allegiance to Mali, but he has since been called up to the La Roja squad that will face Malta and Romania in Euro 2020 Qualifiers this month, as a replacement for the injured Rodrigo. The 23-year-old, who came through the youth ranks at Barcelona, represented Spain at youth level, but has yet to play for the senior team. Traore revealed that he had discussions with the Mali football association about the possibility of donning the colours of the African nation he is eligible to represent through his parents, but insists that he never made a final decision amid conflicting reports. “The truth is I’ve spoken with Mali, but I didn’t sign anything,” Traore told the Express and Star. “I’ve been in contact with them and they’ve shown interest. There has been a bit of confusion. I haven’t decided yet.” The winger has been in good form for Wolves this season and assisted the winner in the club’s 2-1 victory over his former employers Aston Villa in the English Premier League this afternoon. --AllAfrica--
