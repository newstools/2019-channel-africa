The adviser was giving his opinion on a case that pits Amazon against US cosmetics company Coty. The dispute is one of the many battles between luxury goods companies seeking to preserve their exclusivity and branding and online platforms such as Amazon and eBay fighting against online sales curbs. It also raises the question of the scope of online platforms’ responsibility for products sold, or content transmitted, on their sites. The opinion from Manuel Campos Sanchez-Bordona, advocate general at the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU), came in a case involving Coty’s German subsidiary, which took Amazon to a German court for stocking Coty’s Davidoff perfume for third party sellers. Coty said such practices violate its trade mark rights and that Amazon should be liable for stocking trade mark infringing goods. The German court subsequently sought guidance from the CJEU. Companies which are not aware of trade mark infringements cannot be held responsible for storing such products for third party sellers, Campos Sanchez-Bordona said. However, if they are actively involved in distributing the goods and if they operate a scheme like Amazon’s, then they should show diligence in checking the legality of goods sold on their platforms, he said. Under a scheme called “Fulfilled by Amazon”, the US online retail giant stores and delivers goods for third-party sellers, one of the key features of its business model.
