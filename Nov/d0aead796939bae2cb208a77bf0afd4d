After their 1-1 draw with Kenya on Thursday in their opening Group G encounter, Egypt held on for another point on Monday in Comoros. The Pharaohs, once again without the injured Mohamed Salah, began well with Mahmoud 'Kahraba' Abdel-Moneim firing a shot against the bar after nine minutes. Two minutes later they had another good chance after the Comoros keeper was ruled to have picked up a back pass only for the resulting indirect free kick to be blocked and cleared by the hosts' defence. Both sides had their best opportunities to break the deadlock midway through the second half. Firstly, Aston Villa's Trezeguet was put through for a one-on-one with the keeper only to stab his effort wide of the post. Minutes later, Kassim M'Dahoma jinxed his way into the area and his shot was blocked a little fortuitously by keeper Mohamed El Shenawy's shoulder as he dived to make the save. The game was played in intensely hot conditions with the referee allowing official water breaks in both halves of the match. --BBC--
