HSBC, Standard Chartered and India’s Bank of Baroda as well as their senior directors were “directly culpable” in the looting of South Africa’s treasury under Zuma, Hain said in his submission to the Judicial Commission of Inquiry into Allegations of State Capture. Hain was invited to give evidence because he had already named several corporates he was investigating under parliamentary privilege in 2017 as complicit in state capture. HSBC said it fully supported the commission’s inquiry. Standard Chartered and Bank of Baroda did not immediately respond to a request for comment. “They’re all up to their neck in this,” he told the inquiry at his appearance. “They continued because of course the corporates concerned, including the banks, were making money out of it. The Guptas could not have amassed this illicit wealth without the corporates and the banks being their little helpers.” Zuma, who was removed as president last year over corruption allegations, is facing a judicial inquiry. He has agreed to cooperate but has dismissed the probe as prejudiced. Part of its brief is to investigate accusations that the Guptas, prominent businessmen brothers Atul, Ajay and Rajesh, influenced Zuma over political appointments and state contracts. Hain, a labor lord and former anti-Apartheid activist, called on the banks, global corporates and foreign governments to cooperate better so all those involved are brought to justice. In his submission he said a number of international banks helped the Guptas cloak the source of their funds, by allowing them to open and maintain bank accounts, even after allegations of their involvement in corruption became public, and also by allowing them to transfer illicit funds into these accounts.
