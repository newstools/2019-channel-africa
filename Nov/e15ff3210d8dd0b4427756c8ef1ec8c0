The new data law establishes the office of the Data Commissioner and sets out the requirements for the protection of personal data processed by both public and private entities. It further outlines key principles that will govern data processing, sets out the rights of data subjects and assigns duties to data controllers and data processors. In addition to setting the conditions for the transfer of personal data outside Kenya, the Act provides for the exemptions to processing of data and outlines data handling offences and attendant penalties. The Bill was presented to the President for signature at State House Nairobi by National Assembly Speaker Justin Muturi.
