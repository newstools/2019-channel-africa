He was detained along with the former head of an investment firm, James Hatuikulipi. The two men have not commented on the arrests. The head of the country's anti-corruption commission, Paulus Noa, is being quoted by local media as confirming the news but gave no further details. Another former minister, Bernhard Esau, was also detained at the weekend in connection with the case but was released a day later when a judge said the arrest warrant was invalid, the Reuters news agency reports. He denies any wrongdoing. Both Esau and Shanghala resigned as ministers earlier this month when allegations that they had taken bribes in return for fishing quotas emerged. The Icelandic firm, Samherji, is also investigating the allegations. The news comes as Namibians go to the polls to elect a new president and parliament. The allegations over the fishing contracts dominated the latter stages of campaigning. --BBC--
