Notoane's side dictated matters from the start when threatening their opponent's goal from as early as the second minute. The only thing missing from an impressive performance was goals with the deadlock broken eventually in the 78th minute. But what a goal it was to decide the encounter. SuperSport United midfielder, Teboho Mokoena, stepped up to hit an unstoppable free-kick from around 35 yards out to give his side their first win in Group B. "We are very happy to get our first win of the tournament, especially against a strong side such as Ivory Coast," Notoane said. "This was both a tactical and physical battle which needed a special moment to determine the end result, and I am glad that we are the ones who managed to come up with it. "Mokoena was a pleasant surprise for us when he stepped up to take the free-kick," Notoane added. "We have a number of players such as Luther Singh, Sipho Mbule and Kobamelo Kodisang who could normally take free-kicks for us on any given day, however, Mokoena felt pretty confident about this one. "If you ask me, I would not have been happy to have drawn in my second group match - following the 0-0 draw against Zambia - and I am truly happy that we were able to push for this winning result in this tie." As it stands, South Africa are top of Group B with four points after two matches played. They will face second-placed Nigeria who are a point behind in their final group clash on November 15 at the Al Salam Stadium. Notoane said his side will prepare accordingly to fight for another winning result in their last group game.
