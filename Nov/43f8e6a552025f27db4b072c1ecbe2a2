The two suspects were shot for "illegally crossing the border and assaulting police officers", Rwandan police say. Rwanda closed its land border with Uganda in February after the two countries swapped accusations of interference in each other’s affairs. The stand-off has forced traders in both countries to resort to smuggling. “The smugglers became violent and assaulted police officers who reacted in self-defence shooting them dead,” Rwanda police said in a statement. Uganda has said it was investigating the incident, adding that three of its nationals involved in the incident "escaped back to its territory". This is the latest shooting by Rwandan police of suspected smugglers. Last week, two Rwandan nationals were shot as they allegedly attempted to smuggle sweet potatoes from Uganda. Two weeks ago, two Rwandan women were also shot dead after being linked to smuggling. The series of shootings comes even though the presidents of the two countries met in the Angolan capital, Luanda, in August and agreed to end the political tensions. --BBC--
