Anastacio Matavel, 58, was shot dead as he left an election training session in the southern Gaza province just days ahead of October's elections. Tudelo Guirrugo, the commander of the Gaza rapid intervention force, was arrested after officials launched a commission of inquiry into the murder. The case was in the "preparatory stage" and the investigation still ongoing, police spokesperson, Orlando Mudumane, told AFP news agency. Five men armed with assault rifles shot Matavel 10 times before fleeing in a car, which crashed during their getaway. Two died in the crash, one was arrested and two remain at large, police said. Four of the five men in the car were members of the rapid intervention force, authorities said at the time.
