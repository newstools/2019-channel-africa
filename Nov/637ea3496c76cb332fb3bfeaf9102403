United were relegated at the end of the 2018/19 campaign, but after just one fixture in the country’s second-tier, have bought back their top-flight status from Delta Force.

Force, who themselves had purchased the status of promoted Kada City, reportedly could not fund the acquisition in the end and were forced to sell. It is an embarrassing merry-go-round for the country’s football and casts aspersions on the integrity of the competition. United’s history goes back to 1974 when they were a club for the employees of the Kwara Water Corporation, but have been in their current form since 1997.

United will take Force’s place and therefore have four points from their opening five games and currently sit in the relegation zone in the 20-team league. --AllAfrica--
