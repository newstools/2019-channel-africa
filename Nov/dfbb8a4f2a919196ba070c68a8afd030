England went into the contest as favourites after upsetting the All Blacks 19-7 in the semi-finals, but came unstuck against a determined Springbok side, losing 32-12. In an interview with United Kingdom-based The Telegraph, Jones said he erred in naming the same line-up for the final. "I know in my head where we could have probably made improvements. One of the areas was that I probably made a mistake in terms of selection. That's all with the benefit of hindsight, but I should probably have refreshed the team for the final," Jones said. England appeared rattled from the start against an imposing Springbok defence and the South Africans also annihilated the Red Roses at scrum time. Jones added: "It was one of those days. Sometimes they start the game brilliantly and things come off for them. "We start the game a little bit off, lacking a tiny bit of energy because we'd played four big games in a row. That's the reality of it, we just came unstuck." Jones is staying put as England coach for at least two more years, when his current contract expires.
