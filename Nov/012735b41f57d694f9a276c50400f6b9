FIFA says former Tanzanian soccer federation President, Jamal Malinzi, received $528 000 over four years to repay alleged loans he made that “lack proper justification or explanation.” Malinzi also received $55 000 in prize money earned by Tanzania’s under-17 team at the African youth championship in 2017. FIFA says Malinzi was a member of its development committee, allocating project funds worldwide,  and its fair play and social responsibility committee from 2013-17 when he was taking money. Malinzi was also fined $503 000. --AfricaNews--
