JKUAT students went on strike on Sunday leading to the closure of the varsity. Some police officers who had been dispatched to calm the incident at the Juja main campus were caught on video beating an unarmed student which caused a public uproar. Led by the University of Nairobi Students leader Ann Mwangi, they said students have a right to demonstrate at any point but their rights should not be interfered with. "Comrades should be protected. We have a right to demonstrate. When we do demonstrate, let them give us the security to air out our expression wherever we want to say," Ann said. They applauded the move taken by the Interior CS Fred Matiang'i who earlier condemned the attack and said that his office will take action against the officers who were involved. The leaders warned that failure to apprehend responsible officers in the next 24 hours will render JKUAT a no-go-zone. Student leaders also threatened to mobilise other students from all universities to hold a demonstration if action will not be taken. They held a demonstration at Interior CS's office in Jogoo House on Tuesday. The Inspector General of Police Hillary Mutyambai has since directed the service's Internal Affairs Unit to investigate officers filmed attacking a JKUAT student. Through a statement issued on Tuesday, the IG gave the IAU to submit its recommendations over the officers' brutal actions within 24 hours. IPOA and Amnesty International have also condemned police brutality and demand investigation. --TheStar--
