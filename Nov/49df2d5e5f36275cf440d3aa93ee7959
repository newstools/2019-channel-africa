Last week, Russia sided with Burundi at the United Nations Security Council, where the country denied accusations of torture made in a UN report. The report accuses Burundi's ruling party and members of its youth league, the Imbonerakure, of carrying out "killings, disappearances, arbitrary arrests and detentions, acts of torture and rape against actual or alleged political opposition members". Then on Tuesday, Lavrov hosted Burundi's Foreign Minister, Ezechiel Nibigira, in Moscow. Lavrov said Russia will not interfere in Burundi's domestic affairs, reports Russia's state news agency Tass. --BBC--
