The state power utility, which produces most of its electricity from coal, also doesn’t disclose who at the company is responsible for assessing its climate-based risks, the Cape Town-based Centre for Environmental Rights said in a report released on Monday. With its economy heavily dependent on mining and manufacturing, South Africa ranks as the continent’s biggest producer of greenhouse gases and matches the level produced by the UK which has a gross domestic product almost eight times bigger. Eskom, already the subject of lawsuits for air pollution that affects respiratory health, is one of five of the country’s 10 largest polluters that haven’t set any reduction targets. Others include the local unit of ArcelorMittal, wood-pulp company Sappi and cement producer PPC, Sasol South Africa’s second-biggest emitter, has set a target, as have Anglo American Plc and Gold Fields. Sasol, Anglo American and South32 are the only companies of the 10 that have linked executive remuneration to climate targets, according to the report, which is the first of its kind in South Africa. And of those companies only five have disclosed that the board is responsible for oversight of climate-related matters. ArcelorMittal and coal miner Exxaro Resources don’t identify climate change as a material business risk, the report says. Sasol is due to hold its annual general meeting on November 27, 2019, and will be asked whether its emission reduction targets are ambitious enough, according to Just Share, a South African shareholder activism and responsible investment organisation. --IOL--
