Hatton parred the fourth extra sudden-death hole to deny Austria's Matthias Schwab his first European Tour title in the most agonising fashion. That pair were tied on 20-under par at the end of the four days along with South African Erik van Rooyen, French duo Benjamin Hebert and Victor Perez, and American Kurt Kitayama. Hebert, Perez and Van Rooyen fell by the wayside after the first playoff run up the 18th, failing to match their three playoff rivals' birdie fours. Hatton, Schwab and Kitayama all parred the next attempt to find an outright winner, but Kitayama's par at the third playoff hole saw him head back to the clubhouse, leaving Hatton and Schwab to hop in their buggies and head back down to the 18th tee. For the last time, as it turned out with Hatton making par to Schwab's bogey to deny the 24-year-old Austrian his first ever title having led the tournament since Thursday's first round. This was Hatton's fourth title and it came with a handsome Â£1.56 million cheque. "It's so surreal," he said. "I can't actually believe that I won. It's been quite a difficult year in terms of things happening off the course, but in the last month I feel like I've really found my game again." Hatton had begun the final round four shots off the lead, but ended the last man standing in the Turkish twilight. He had muscled his way into the playoff with a closing birdie, and had to chip in to keep his title hopes alive after the first trip back up the last.
