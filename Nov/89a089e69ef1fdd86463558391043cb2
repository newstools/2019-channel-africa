Domingos Simoes Pereira finished first with 40% and Umaro Cissoko Embalo came second with 28% in the November 24 first-round poll, Commission President, Jose Pedro Sambu, told reporters. They will face off in a second round on December. 29. Vaz, who has governed the tiny West African country since 2014, only received 12% of the vote. He has regularly feuded with the majority party in parliament and cycled through seven different prime ministers. Critics say Vaz, 61, failed to control corruption or stem the flow of drugs through the cashew-producing country on their way from South America to Europe. Pereira, 56, was Vazâ€™s first prime minister before being sacked in 2015. He campaigned as a modernizer whose promise to bolster health and education made him popular with younger voters in Bissau. Embalo, 47, also served as prime minister under Vaz from 2016-18.
