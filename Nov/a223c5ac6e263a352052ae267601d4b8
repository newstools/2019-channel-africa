The world’s largest planemaker suspended load testing of the new widebody in September when media reports said a cargo door failed a ground stress test. There have also been issues with General Electric Co’s (GE.N) new GE9X turbine engine that will power the jet. The Seattle Times, which first reported new details on the testing issue, said photos it had obtained of the test on the 777X showed that the extent of the damage was greater than previously disclosed and earlier reports were wrong about crucial details. During the final load testing of a 777X test airplane, engineers ran a test that involved flexing the aircraft’s wings beyond what is expected during normal commercial service, Boeing said. “A testing issue occurred during the final minutes of the test, at approximately 99% of the final test loads, and involved a depressurisation of the aft fuselage,” Boeing said. The company did not see any significant impact on the jetliner’s design or preparations for first flight, and it did not see any impact from the test on the overall program schedule, Boeing said. The 777X is due to fly for the first time in early 2020, with the first jet on track to be delivered to an airline in 2021, Boeing has said. Boeing shares were down 0.6% at $371.09.
