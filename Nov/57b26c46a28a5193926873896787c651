The 22-year-old breaststroke star also picked up the Sportswoman of the Year award. Schoenmaker had a breakthrough performance at the 2018 Commonwealth Games where she claimed two gold medals. Earlier this year Schoenmaker became the first South African female swimmer to win a medal at a FINA World Championships when she took silver in the 200m breaststroke in Gwangju. According to SABC's website, the 22-year-old Schoenmaker couldn't collect her award in person as she is writing her final exams at the University of Pretoria. Following her win, Schoenmaker took to Twitter to thank the public for her win. "Oh my. Did that just happen?!? Thank you, thank you! ... So incredibly honoured to be named Â #SportsWomanOfTheYear and #SportsStarOfTheYear @SASportAwards. Thank you South Africa and the judges for believing in me!," she wrote. Other big winners included Springbok Rugby World Cup winning-captain Siya Kolisi, who won the People's Choice Award. Kolisi is in the midst of a nationwide tour with the team after they defeated England 32-12 in the final in Yokohama to lift their third Webb Ellis Cup.
