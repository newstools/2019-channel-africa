Mozambique government spokesperson, and the Deputy Minister of Culture and Tourism, Ana Comoana, announced the recent ban to reporters after the weekly meeting of the Council of Ministers (Cabinet), Mozambique Club reported. In addition to the ban, other precautionary measures will include stepped up livestock inspection measures, particularly in areas near the South African border. Maputoâ€™s move follows similar bans from Zimbabwe, which last Friday banned the import of South African beef, pork and meat from other hoofed animals. The foot-and-mouth virus is highly contagious in hoofed animals causing high mortality rates among young animals, and can survive even after the animal is dead. Hoofed animals from SA are now banned from entering Mozambique after an outbreak of the foot-and-mouth disease in the animals in Limpopo. Video: Zodidi Dano/African News Agency. --ANA--
