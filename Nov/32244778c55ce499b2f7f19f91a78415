Kampala Metropolitan Police Spokesperson, Patrick Onyango, says a further 73 people are still being held in a police station and could be taken to court. Police say narcotics, including opium and cannabis, were found at the premise, but gay activists believe the operation had targeted the LGBTQ community. The activists say no effort was made to differentiate between those in possession of banned substances and those partying. Homosexual acts are illegal in Uganda under the penal code and the government has denied recent claims that new legislation is being planned to further criminalise LGBTQ people.
