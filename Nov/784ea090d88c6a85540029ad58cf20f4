By Friday Â heavy rains had killed at least 10 people and displaced more than 270 000 in Somalia, destroying infrastructure and livelihoods in the Horn of Africa nation, the UN said. In the town of Beledweyne in central Somalia, a river overflowed and about 10 people died when a boat capsized trying to rescue stranded residents, residents said. East Africa has been experiencing heavy rains, experts say, with floods forcing families from their homes. The Indian Ocean Dipole, the Indian Ocean's equivalent of the Pacific Ocean-based El Nino, is at its strongest since 2006, the regional trade bloc of eight East African nations known as the Intergovernmental Authority on Development said. --Reuters--
