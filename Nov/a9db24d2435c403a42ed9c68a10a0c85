The mayor has restricted time for all bars in the city over security. The order followed a meeting between the Public Security Minister Alain Guillaume Bunyoni and Interior Minister Pascal Barandagiye. The agenda of the closed door meeting, also attended by security and government officials, was the status of the country’s security ahead of next year’s general election. In his letter, the mayor states; “The opening hours of bars and other drinking places is strictly from 5pm to 9pm during weekdays and from 1pm to 9pm on weekends and public holidays.” The same letter also banned street vendors in and around the city with immediate effect. Local administrators and police commissioners are expected to implement the order. Early last month, a group of unknown armed assailants shot dead three people and wounded three others in a bar in the city centre. --TheEastAfrican--
