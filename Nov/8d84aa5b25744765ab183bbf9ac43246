The map in question, which was shared online, had not marked the Eritrean territory, creating an impression that Ethiopia's land border extended to the Red Sea. Takele Uma tweeted that an "honest" mistake had been made which required an "immediate resolution". He also said the complaint had alerted his office of other mistakes on the map. Eritrean Press, a news site linked to Eritrea, had demanded the correction of the "offending" map, whose picture was taken when Takele hosted Muriel Bowser, the mayor of Washington DC, in Addis Ababa. "Eritean Press thanks the Ethiopian government for taking the swift response by removing the offending map photo from all its social media sites an hour after our post," the news site said on its Facebook page. Eritrea won independence from Ethiopia in 1993 after a 30-year war.
--BBC-- Thank you to our Eritrean brothers & sisters for bringing attention to the error on the glass map of Africa. Honest mistakes require honest & immediate resolution, which is why it has been taken down. Due to the notifications we actually caught multiple errors on the map.
