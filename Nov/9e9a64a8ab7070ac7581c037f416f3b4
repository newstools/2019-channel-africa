Lee Njiru said the former president, who left hospital last week on Thursday, was back in hospital two days later. “I appeal to the press fraternity not to cause unwarranted alarm by exploiting the credulity of the masses,”Njiru said about ongoing speculation about the former president's health. He said the 95-year-old was "alert and being attended to by a professional medical team". Moi led Kenya for 24 years from 1978.
