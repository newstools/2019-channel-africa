"Since we began the marketing process earlier this year, there has been interest and we expect even more interest now that the litigation has concluded," a spokesperson told Fin24. EDC in April 2015 loaned Westdawn Investments $41 million to purchase the Canadian-built Bombardier Global 6000, roughly 80% of the aircraft's purchase price of $52 million. The Johannesburg High Court in April 2018 ruled that the jet be grounded after the family started to default on their loans.  

It later ruled that a sale could go ahead, but the jet could not be moved as Westdawn Investments took the EDC to court in the United Kingdom. Since the initial court ruling the jet has been grounded at Lanseria airport. EDC now says that it has concluded litigation in the UK and can proceed with the aircraft's sale. "With the settlement, Westdawn withdrew its objection to EDC’s termination of the business relationship. No money was exchanged as part of the settlement and Westdawn will not be entitled to any proceeds from the sale of the aircraft." The EDC said that, prior to the settlement, the export credit agency was restricted to marketing and advertising the aircraft for eventual sale.
