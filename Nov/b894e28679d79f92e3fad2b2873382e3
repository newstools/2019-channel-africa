Steyn, who retired from Test cricket in August, only played two IPL games this season after picking up a shoulder injury, which significantly resulted in him missing the Cricket World Cup in England. Proteas all-rounder Chris Morris was also dropped by the Delhi Capitals after picking up 13 wickets and only scoring 32 runs in his nine games. Hard-hitting batsman David Miller had a disappointing showing with the bat for the Kings XI Punjab as he scored 213 runs in 10 games. Reigning champions the Mumbai Indians have released Proteas fast bowler Beuran Hendricks, while they retained Proteas wicketkeeper/batsman Quinton de Kock. Chennai Super Kings retained Proteas star trio Imran Tahir, Faf du Plessis and Lungi Ngidi after their impressive season with the runners-up. IPL's highest wicket-taker, Kagiso Rabada, was also retained by the Delhi Capitals after the Proteas fast bowler picked up 25 wickets in his 12 games. India's favourite South African, AB de Villiers, was retained by Royal Challengers Bangalore, which has been his IPL franchise since 2011. Proteas fast bowler, Hardus Viljoen, was retained by the Kings XI Punjab side after taking seven wickets in his six games this season. Viljoen, who recently ended his Kolpak contract with Derbyshire, has played only one Test match for the Proteas in 2016. The IPL 2020 player auction will take place in Kolkata on December 19, 2019.
