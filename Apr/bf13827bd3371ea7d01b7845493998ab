He appeared in a video with uniformed men, saying he had military support.  Guaidó, who declared himself interim president in January, called for more members of the military to help him end Maduro's "usurpation" of power. The military has generally supported Maduro in the stand-off with Guaidó. But as resentment has grown following years of hyperinflation, power cuts, food and medicine shortages, Maduro's detractors hope the military will change its allegiance. So far, they have stood by Maduro despite dozens of countries, including the US and most of Latin America, recognising Guaidó as Venezuela's rightful leader. The world is now watching to see if Guaidó's latest bid will be the moment Maduro is toppled from power. Maduro, however, has emerged saying he still has the full support of the military. Protesters supporting both sides have gathered at different points in the capital, Caracas. There are running clashes between Guaidó's supporters and armed military vehicles. Protesters were also seen throwing rocks, but being repelled by tear gas and water cannon. Television cameras also caught the moment armoured vehicles drove into a crowd but it is unclear if there were any injuries.  --BBC--
