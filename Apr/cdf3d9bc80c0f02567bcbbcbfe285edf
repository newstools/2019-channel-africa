Equity's announcement marks the third major deal among lenders in Kenya. This is since the government capped commercial lending rates in 2016, compressing their profit margins and forcing them to look for survival strategies, including consolidation. Equity further said it was entering transaction agreements to acquire via a share swap 62% of the share capital of Rwanda's commercial bank, Banque Populaire du Rwanda, and 100% of African Banking Corporation of Zambia, African Banking Corporation Tanzania and African Banking Corporation Mozambique. Equity Group, Kenya's second biggest bank by assets, said it would issue 252Â 482 300 new shares, representing 6.27% of its expanded share capital in consideration of the shares Atlas Mara owns in the target banks. Equity said "This implies that the monetary value of the consideration to be paid is the equivalent of approximately $105.4 million" The deal is subject to regulatory approvals in the various countries and once finalised, Atlas Mara would become one of Equity's shareholders, it said. Equity added it may also seek to buy additional stakes in Banque Populaire du Rwanda from some or all of the remaining shareholders. Just last week, Kenya's biggest lender by assets KCB Group, offered to buy National Bank of Kenya through a share swap. --The Star--
