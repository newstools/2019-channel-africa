Els joins three-time Major winner Padraig Harrington, former world No 1 Lee Westwood and triumphant 2018 Ryder Cup captain Thomas Bjorn. Els, a two-time US Open winner and a two-time Open Champion, has 71 international titles under his belt, including 28 European Tour victories. "I am really happy to be playing in the Czech Republic this year," said Els in a video presentation for Czech fans, quoted by the European Tour website. "I have only been to Prague once and that was several years ago. I would like to take this opportunity to invite spectators to Albatross to see some world-class golf and, I hope, a lot of birdies. Thanks for the invitation and see you at the Czech Master." Harrington, who will lead the 2020 Ryder Cup team at Whistling Straits in the USA, came close to victory at Albatross last year but was eventually beaten to the title by Italian Andrea Pavan. Westwood, meanwhile, will play in the tournament for the fourth time in a row. Winner of 43 tournaments in global golfing series, Westwood claimed his maiden Rolex Series title last November at the Nedbank Golf Challenge. Bjorn has 15 European Tour wins to his name. "We are delighted to be able to welcome great players to the Czech Republic year after year," said Petr Dedek, owner of the Relmost promotion company. "Ernie Els, Lee Westwood, Padraig Harrington and Thomas Bjorn rank among the best golfers of the modern era. The prestige of this tournament is growing and the audience will enjoy an exceptional golfing experience in August." At least 10 Czech golfers will again be participating in the tournament including two amateurs. The tournament gets underway from August 15-18. --News24--
