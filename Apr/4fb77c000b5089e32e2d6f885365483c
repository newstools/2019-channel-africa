Sural, a 28-year-old striker, dies at the hospital where he and six of his teammates, including one-cap England international Steven Caulker, were taken after the crash. Seven Alanyaspor players were making their way back from the club’s 1-1 draw against Kayserispor in a private bus on Sunday when it veered off the road around five kilometres (3.1 miles) from the coastal town of Alanya, Turkey’s central Mediterranean coast Caulker joined the club in January after a spell with Dundee. Former Newcastle striker Papiss Cisse had also played in the fixture. Alanyaspor's chairman, Hasan Cavusoglu, cited police sources who said the bus had two drivers and both fell asleep Cavusoglu further explains "The crash happened as a result of them both being asleep.” Sural, who won 20 caps for his country and scored once, was rushed to a nearby hospital and immediately taken for an operation, but could not be saved by doctors. It's reported locally that both Caulker and Cisse were among the players who picked up minor injuries. Sural moved to Turkey from his homeland in January, signing from Sparta Prague for a nominal fee. --Standard Media--
