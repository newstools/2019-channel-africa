Royal Dutch Shell has declared force majeure on exports of Nigeria’s Bonny Light crude following the closure of one of two export pipelines, the company said on Monday. Amenam, operated by oil major Total , is also under force majeure, trading sources said. Both grades of crude are light and sweet, typically suitable for gasoline production. The Bonny Light-exporting Nembe Creek Trunk Line closed on April 21 following a fire, operator Aiteo said, and Shell said it had declared force majeure on April 25. Bonny Light exports had been planned at 222 000 barrels per day (bpd) in June and 184 000 bpd in May, but trading sources said they were awaiting new loading plans. Shell said the export terminal continued to run. A port source told Reuters that oil-well shutdowns had reduced Amenam’s daily production and led to force majeure. Exports of Amenam are typically around 100 000 bpd, and trading sources said loadings had been delayed by roughly 25 days. Operator Total did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Two Shell oil workers were kidnapped last week in Rivers state, an escalation that helped prompt state police to step up security operations. --Reuters--
