“Notice is hereby given that as a result of the dividend declaration relating to Anheuser-Busch Inbev SA/NV (ANH) shares, the holders of ANHSTA share instalments will receive an Anheuser-Busch InBev SA/NV (ANH) dividend per instalment gross dividend,” the group said. Last year the group went through a rough patch after being beleaguered by debt, partly stemming from the SABMiller acquisition and under-performance particularly in the under-performing emerging markets of Brazil, Russia and China. AB InBev has reversed course in 2019, largely because of its commitment to right-size its balance sheet, analyst optimism, post-earnings gains, and new product innovation, from cocktails to cannabis. While sceptics remain, the shares have climbed 27.7 % to date, although that still leaves AB InBev down 23 % for the latest 12 months. The company produces a third of the world’s beer and its takeover of SABMiller in 2016 was largely done to acquire SABMiller’s emerging markets, with a focus on South Africa as the launch pad to the rest of the continent. The group expects to launch its first brewery in Mozambique later this year, and production started last year in Nigeria, while plans are on the table to build a brewery in Tanzania. The group said the dividend, which would be paid out next month, remained subject to the dividend withholding Tax Rate of 20%. The net dividend will be announced after an exchange rate announcement in cents. “One of AB InBev’s billionaire shareholders believes Africa’s rapid urbanisation and warm climate could eventually see it overtake the US in beer sales,” an analyst said on Monday. AB InBev had already made significant investments in the local market. --IOL--
