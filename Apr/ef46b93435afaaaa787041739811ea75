The Ivory Coast international was forced off with a knee injury during the second half of Sunday's 1-1 draw against Chelsea at Old Trafford. United have now confirmed the 25-year-old suffered medial ligament damage. Bailly, who had been making his first appearance since limping out of the Champions League clash with Paris St-Germain on March 6, was hurt in a collision with Mateo Kovacic. Manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer said after the game Bailly would almost certainly miss the season's final games against Huddersfield and Cardiff and now his hopes of representing his country this summer are also over. Ivory Coast are among the favourites for the African Nations Cup, which takes place in Egypt from June 21 to July 19. A statement on the club's website read: "We can confirm that Manchester United defender Eric Bailly suffered a medial ligament injury on his right knee during Sunday's Premier League match against Chelsea at Old Trafford. "The problem means that the Ivory Coast international will not play for the Reds again this season, missing the remaining top-flight matches against Huddersfield Town and Cardiff City. Furthermore, Bailly is also now unable to play in the upcoming Africa Cup of Nations tournament."
