MTN said Ebitda margin expanded by 5.9 percentage points to 47.9 % in the quarter on the back of an increase in service and data revenue, which went up 21.9 % and 22.3 % respectively. “MTN Ghana delivered a solid performance for the quarter. Service revenue increased by 21.9 % year-on-year (y/y) benefiting from good growth in voice revenue up 20.3 %, data revenue up 22.3 % and mobile financial services revenue up 51 %,” the group said yesterday. MTN said it also managed to increase its subscriber base during the period to 20.8 million people from 18.6 million during the corresponding period last year. Active data subscribers shot up a whopping 113.43 %to 14.3 million, compared to last year’s subscribers of 6.7 million, while active mobile money subscribers increased by 17.86 % to 9.9 million, up from 8.4 million last year. MTN stabilised its business in the West African region after it had its fair share of troubles in that territory. Last September it was ordered by Nigeria’s central bank to refund around $8.13billion that it allegedly had illegally repatriated from the country. Going forward MTN Ghana said it will continue to pursue its Bright strategy in the second quarter of 2019. “As 2019 has been declared as the year of the customer, with prime focus on customer experience as a tool to create value for shareholders,” the group said. --IOL--
