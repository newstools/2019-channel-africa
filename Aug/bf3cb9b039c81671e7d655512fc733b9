Opposition and civil society groups have announced they will be holding massive protests that will include disruption of services at borders and airports from Monday. But Mutharika has warned he would take all necessary measures to defend the country from those he says want to "usurp power from him". Malawi has faced increased rallies since last May following the narrow and controversial win of Mutharika in elections that the opposition claim was marred by fraud and irregularities. The opposition has lodged a challenge to the poll results at the constitutional court which is currently listening to the petition.
