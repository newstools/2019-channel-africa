This news comes after it was confirmed this past weekend that Cricket South Africa (CSA) have parted ways with head coach Ottis Gibson and his core backroom staff. Sport24 revealed that there will no longer be a head coach appointment moving forward. Instead, CSA had created the role of 'team director'. The Team Director will take on the responsibilities of the head coach and will report to the director of cricket, who will report directly to the Chief Executive Officer. For the time being, the man in charge is Corrie van Zyl, who will serve as an acting Director of Cricket. According to the Daily Mail website, Moores, who is currently head coach at Nottinghamshire, has emerged as a leading candidate for the Proteas gig. The 56-year-old's three-year contract with the county club reportedly runs out at the end of the English summer. Moores was in charge of England national side for two spells from 2007-2009 and 2014-2015. He was involved in a public fall out with South African-born England batsman Kevin Pietersen, which resulted in Moores' removal from the England and Wales Cricket Board.
