Demonstrations have been regularly staged since the May 21 elections, aimed at forcing out Electoral Commission chairwoman Jane Ansah over her handling of the poll.

The protest organisers, the Human Rights Defenders Coalition, had dubbed Tuesday's rally the "One Million March," in a quest to draw a million marchers to the cities of Lilongwe, Blantyre and Mzuzu.

A Lilongwe-based journalist, Golden Matonga, estimated the turnout in the capital in the hundreds of thousands.

In commercial centre of Blantyre, more than 20 000 took part.

Participation was slightly lower in Mzuzu, the landlocked southern African country's third largest city, sources said.

While the protests in Blantyre and Mzuzu were generally peaceful, the Lilongwe event was marred by violence, including the burning of a police armoured vehicle.

Calm return after the military was deployed, witnesses said.Â Residents said they had seen cars being torched and shops looted.

"Apart from the police vehicle, I saw at least two other government vehicles being burnt and shops literally being ransacked along the path of demonstrations," local resident Patrick Banda told AFP.
