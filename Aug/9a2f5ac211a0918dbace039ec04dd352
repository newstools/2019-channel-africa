The Northern Trust Open tees off on Thursday at Liberty National GC in New Jersey. South African hopefuls Louis Oosthuizen, Branden Grace and Dylan Frittelli will compete for a share of the $9 million (R136 million) prize purse. The defending champion is American Bryson DeChambeau. This is the first event of the PGA Tour's FedEx Cup playoffs, with the top 70 in the points race after the event moving on to the next leg of the three-event series, the BMW Championship near Chicago. The leading three South Africans on the ladder heading into the tournament are Oosthuizen (25th), Justin Harding (52nd) and Grace (72nd). The European Tour resumes next week with the Czech Masters in Prague, while the local Sunshine Tourâ€™s next event will be the Vodacom Origins Shishen on August 22.
