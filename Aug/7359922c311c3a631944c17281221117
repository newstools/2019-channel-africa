The results were delivered on the back of a 5 % rise in interest income to $250 million as non-funded income grew 15 % to $130 million. “The bottom-line was impacted by 266 % jump in loan loss provision from $8 million to $30 million. This is something we are looking at keenly to deliver a robust second half performance,” Group Chief Finance Officer Lawrence Kimathi commented Thursday during the release of results in Nairobi. He said that the jump was as a result of absence of one off benefit of passing non-performing loans through balance sheet as was last year during transitioning to new accounting standard. KCB’s growth in interest income was chiefly driven by 13.8 % growth in loan book, pushing up interest on loans and advances to customers. --TheEastAfrican--
