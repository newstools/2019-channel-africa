Tebas has been a vocal critic of City in the past, stating in 2017 that "they have invented fictitious, state-linked sponsors with amounts that do not match market prices". He denied that his condemnation of the club had any racial undertones earlier in 2019. And with the club still under a UEFA investigation over alleged financial violations, Tebas says they are one of a handful of sides that represent a threat to the game in its current state. "The governors of European football need to show a much stronger commitment to healthy domestic football," Tebas told the Totally Football Show. "This would include stricter financial controls that limit state clubs like Manchester City or PSG from vastly outspending their rivals and it would also include much firmer Financial Fair Play penalties, which have been a very weak deterrent up to this point. "A state-run club would be totally against our financial rules in Spain. Any investor that wants to come into La Liga has to agree to our financial controls and we would not allow any investor that would create debt or inflate the market. We would not allow it to happen. "Barcelona and Real Madrid have never received state support and have always been run in a financially responsible way.Â
