Mthethwa and Ndabeni-Abrahams met with Premier Soccer League (PSL) Chairperson, Dr Irvin Khoza, MultiChoice Executive Chairperson, Imtiaz Patel and Chief Executive Officer, Calvo Mawela on Tuesday. The objective of the meeting was to pave the way for a sustainable and long-term solution to the dispute that has resulted in PSL matches not being broadcast on the public broadcaster. The meeting follows an intervention made by the two ministers two weeks ago, when both ministers met with the public broadcaster. Having heard from both the PSL and Multichoice, Mthethwa confirmed that in 48 hours all affected parties will once again meet and what will culminate from that discussion will be an announcement that will constitute a breakthrough in the current impasse. --Sport24--
