The country's economic crisis took a turn for the worse last week after President Mauricio Macri suffered a devastating loss in primary elections, and his economic minister resigned as currency plunged in value. "We are closely following recent developments in Argentina and are in on-going dialogue with the authorities as they work on their policy plans to address the difficult situation that the country is facing," IMF spokesperson Gerry Rice said in a statement. "An IMF staff team will travel to Buenos Aires soon." Ratings agencies downgraded Argentina's debt on Friday, as investors fled the country and the outlook deteriorated. Populist Peronist candidate Alberto Fernandez, now the clear favourite to unseat Macri, has questioned the reform program backed by a $56 billion IMF rescue package. He said the country is "virtually" in default and should renegotiate the IMF loan. The IMF had praised the Macri administration's performance, and said the belt-tightening reforms were starting to yield results that would spur economic growth. The fund has released just over $44 billion so far as part of the three-year loan program, but many economists have said the amount is not enough to stem the tide of Argentina's economic woes. --AFP--
