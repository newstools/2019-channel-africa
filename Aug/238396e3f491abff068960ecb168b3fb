The migrants remain stranded as no European member-state asked the European Union to co-ordinate the disembarking among countries. The Ocean Viking ship, run by Doctors without Borders with Franco-German charity, SOS Mediterranee, rescued 81 people on Sunday and another 105 on Monday, making a total of 356 on board of the aid boat. Spanish Non-Governmental Organisation, Open Arms, has been at sea for 12 days and still waiting for a safe port to disembark the 151 rescued migrants. Italian Deputy Prime Minister, Matteo Salvini has said Spain should accept the Open Arms migrants and repeated his policy of closed ports. Last week, the European Union's executive called on member-states to show solidarity and find a solution for the boat.
