The Gunners have made the perfect start to the Premier League this season, winning their first two games in the league for the first time since 2009-10, after seeing off Burnley on Saturday. They haven’t been at their brilliant best, but their attacking options have helped them to come through tests with Newcastle and the Clarets. Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang, in particular, has been key with his two goals helping them over the line in both of those matches. It’s in defence that Emery still has plenty of issues to resolve and that will likely come to the fore when they face Liverpool at Anfield this weekend. Arsenal lost captain Laurent Koscielny over the summer and injuries have left them short in that position so far this term. Callum Chambers and Sokratis Papastathopoulos started in the heart of defence at St James’ Park, while summer signing David Luiz played alongside the latter on Saturday. Shkodran Mustafi has been omitted from the matchday squad so far this season as Arsenal hope to move him on before the European transfer windows close. They are even looking light in the full-back positions at present with new arrival Kieran Tierney and Hector Bellerin both on the treatment table.
