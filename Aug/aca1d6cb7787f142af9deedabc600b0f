The special report by the UN’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), written by more than 100 scientists, called for big changes to land use, farming and eating habits to help cut emissions that are heating up the Earth. "Finally, the world’s top scientists recognizes what we have always known," said indigenous leaders from 42 countries in a statement coordinated by the Rights and Resources Initiative, a US based coalition promoting community-based forest ownership. "Failure to legally recognise our rights leaves our forests vulnerable to environmentally destructive projects that devastate forests and release massive amounts of carbon into the atmosphere." The IPCC met this week in Geneva, Switzerland, to finalize the report, intended to guide governments tasked with implementing the 2015 Paris Agreement to limit climate change. In 2018, the IPCC’s first special report said keeping the Earth’s temperature rise to the lowest target of 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit) above pre-industrial times set in the Paris accord required rapid shifts across society. Thursday’s IPCC report called for wiser land use, including protecting forests from being cut down for crops and grazing, and eco-friendly farming that uses fewer chemicals, such as fertilizers which emits planet-warming nitrous oxide. Indigenous people customarily own more than 50% of the world’s lands, yet governments only recognizes their ownership rights to 10%, they said. "This gap between our legal and customary rights renders us and our lands vulnerable to the growing threats of agro-industrial production, destructive mining and logging practices, and large-scale infrastructure developments," they said. "And we face increasing criminalisation and violence for our efforts to protect Mother Earth. At least 365 land rights defenders were killed since the Paris Agreement was signed." --Reuters--
