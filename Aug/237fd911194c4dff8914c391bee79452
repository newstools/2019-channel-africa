According to a letter sent to both clubs, if they miss the deadline FIFA will issue its own ruling, which is subject to appeal. "We can confirm that a letter was sent to the parties on behalf of the chairman of the playersâ€™ status committee. Please understand we cannot comment further at this stage," FIFA said in a statement to AFP. Nantes appealed to the commission in February after Cardiff failed to pay $19 million the French club said it was owed following the transfer of Argentine striker Sala, who died on January 17 in a plane crash while travelling to join his new club. Cardiff had earlier resolved not to pay a first instalment of $7 million of the $19 million fee agreed before the accident.
