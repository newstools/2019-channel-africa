Anousheh Ashouri, a woman with British and Iranian citizenship, got 10 years in prison for feeding information to Israel's Mossad spy agency, judiciary spokesperson, Gholamhossein Esmaili, said. The latest Iranian national with a Western passport to be detained in the Islamic republic, she was also handed a two-year prison term for receiving $36 600 in illicit funds from Israel and ordered to pay the same amount in fines. Her sentence came as Iran's judiciary confirmed a 10-year jail sentence against British Council staffer Aras Amiri for "cultural infiltration". Amiri was "sentenced to 10 years in jail and she is already serving her term. This verdict has been upheld by the court," said Esmaili. The judiciary's Mizan Online website reported Amiri's original sentence on May 13, saying she had "made a straightforward confession". At the time, Esmaili said she had been tasked with drawing up and managing cultural "infiltration" projects. Amiri, a Iranian national who had been living in London, was reportedly arrested in 2018 during a trip to visit relatives in Iran. Iranian authorities shut down the British Council's office in Tehran more than a decade ago for what Esmaili described as "illegal activities". The council describes itself as the United Kingdom's organisation for cultural relations and educational opportunities. The verdicts come amid tensions between Iran and United States ally, Britain, over the seizure of oil tankers in recent weeks. An Iranian supertanker was seized off the British overseas territory of Gibraltar on July 4 on suspicion of shipping oil to Syria in breach of European Union sanctions.Â
