The president was addressing hundreds of Rwandan youth on Wednesday, where he alluded to an incident in the capital Kigali last month in which more than 5 000 youth paid for a ‘wealth summit’ that did not take place. On July 25, more than 5 000 people thronged Kigali Convention Centre for the conference but were left stranded after no speakers turned up. “Police went to the hotel where the individuals had planned this conference and found that the hotel did not know anything about it. They later found that an individual had registered to host a conference of 500 people. But the number that turned up was 5 000 people,” Kagame said. “When the individual noticed that many people had turned up for the conference, he started collecting money from them, and they actually paid it. The ones who had borrowed, the ones who had nothing else, they all paid it. And there were others that had paid online.” Rwanda’s National Prosecution Authority charged three Kenyans and one Rwandan with fraud over the ‘wealth conference’ that never came to pass. The charges could attract a possible sentence of up to three years in jail if they are found guilty. --TheEastAfrican--
