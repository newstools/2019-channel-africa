Tshisekedi, son of the late veteran opposition leader Etienne Tshisekedi, won a bitterly contested election in December, marking the first peaceful transition of power since DRC gained independence from Belgium in 1960. Since coming to power, President Tshisekedi has agreed to work with the party of former President Joseph Kabila. "The government is finally here. The president has signed the decree and we will begin work soon," the AFP news agency quotes Prime Minister, Sylvestre Ilunga, as saying.
