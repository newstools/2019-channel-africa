The National Health Insurance (NHI) program, to be debated in parliament soon, is one of the country’s biggest policy changes since white minority rule ended in 1994, and a cornerstone of government plans to fix a crisis-ridden system in which deep racial disparities persist. Against a backdrop of a struggling economy and a corruption-riddled corporate sector, some opposition politicians and analysts have however questioned its affordability. Responding to that concern, Olive Shisana - a special advisor to President Cyril Ramaphosa - said the program would be phased in over a number of years. “This government is not going to do something that will collapse the economy,” she told Reuters in an interview. “(The plan) is for gradual, incremental implementation in a fiscally responsible manner.” Expenditure for NHI in the current fiscal year, which began on April 1, is budgeted at around R2 billion. Shisana said this would rise to around R33 billion ($2.2 billion) in the 2025/26 fiscal year.
