Kabendera, a reporter for local and international press outlets known for his critical coverage of the government, was denied bail in a Dar es Salaam court after the charges were read out against him. "He has just been formally charged with economic crimes, namely organised crime to acquire money, tax evasion and money laundering," a member of his defence team, Shilinde Swedy, told AFP. "These are crimes for which bail is excluded under Tanzanian law. So he remains in detention." Kabendera was arrested on his doorstep by six men in plain clothes on July 29 and brought in for questioning over what police said were irregularities with his citizenship. His detention provoked outrage, with rights groups saying police often wield baseless queries about nationality in order to harass critics and browbeat them into silence. That line of inquiry was later dropped, and authorities announced Kabendera was facing a much more serious charge of sedition under Tanzania's controversial cybercrime laws. But prosecutors had seemingly abandoned those charges as well, Swedy said. "The sedition charges were not brought before the judge," he said. Kabendera had written about being stalked and harassed in the years since Magufuli's election in 2015, with his mother hauled in for gruelling interrogations as well. --AFP--
