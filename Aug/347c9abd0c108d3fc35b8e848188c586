UNHCR says both the governments should remember their commitment to uphold international obligations and ensure that any returns are voluntary in line with the tripartite agreement signed in March last year. Tanzanian authorities on Tuesday said they had reached an agreement with Burundi to send all Burundian refugees back home from October 1.Â 

About 400 000 Burundian refugees have sought asylum elsewhere in the region, according to UNHCR. An estimated 200 000 of them are sheltering in Burundi. --Statement/AP--
