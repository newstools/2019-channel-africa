The company’s operating profit was $2.54 billion in the first quarter, versus an average estimate of $3 billion from four analysts polled by Refinitiv. Its smartphone subscribers rose 372 000 from three months earlier as SoftBank markets a plan targeting heavy data users. The telco maintained its full-year operating profit forecast at $9  billion , up 9% from the previous year. SoftBank Corp has hiked its stake in Yahoo Japan Corp (4689.T) and turned the internet company into a subsidiary to drive growth outside its wireless business. The Yahoo stake and its first ever share buyback announced last month have helped support SoftBank Corp’s shares. The stock closed down 0.5% ahead of the earnings. SoftBank Corp had Japan’s largest ever listing in December as parent SoftBank Group Corp (9984.T) refocuses on technology investing. The telco’s outline for expansion includes a platform for autonomous driving that it has set up with Toyota Motor (7203.T) and plans to export.
