Mr Ekweremadu, who once served as deputy president of Nigeria's upper chamber of parliament, was roughed up and manhandled on Saturday at an annual Igbo cultural festival in the German city of Nuremberg. The police said the politician was then escorted back to his vehicle where eggs were thrown at his vehicle. In a Facebook post, Mr Ekweremadu said his attackers were members of the banned group, the Indigenous People of Biafra (Ipob). According to the Igbo politician, the men "began to complain about the killings in the south-east, stressing that there would be no Igbo event at the venue" before they assaulted him. He said that despite being "disappointed", he did not "hold this to heart against them". The Igbo community is one of the largest in Africa and in Nigeria represents 24% of the population. Ipob is a movement pushing to break away from Nigeria to form the independent nation of Biafra.
