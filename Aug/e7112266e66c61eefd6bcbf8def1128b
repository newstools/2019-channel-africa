The long-standing coach kept faith with most of the squad that played in their last outing in March, when they were beaten by Cameroon 3-0 at the conclusion of the 2019 African Nations Cup qualifiers. There is a return for striker Ben El Fardou, who has already scored in the preliminary rounds of the European Champions League for his new club Red Star Belgrade. Dutch-based winger Said Bakari is also included, while there are first call-ups for centre back Safwan Mbae and striker Ibroihim Djoudja. There is no place for captain Kassim Abdallah or midfielder Rafihdine Abdullah who are both without a club. Abdullah was last at Belgian top flight outfit Waasland-Beveren but left in January. Veteran striker Salim Mozini, 33, has also been omitted in a clear signal his international career looks at an end. All three were in the starting line-up in Yaounde. Also dropped are Abdallah Imamo and Aadail Asana. There is only one locally-based player in the squad - midfielder Andhum Simba from Volcan Club, who have been competing in the Arab Champions Cup this month. Comoros host Togo in the first leg in Moroni on September 6 and then go to Lome for the return four days later. Comoros are participating in only their fourth World Cup qualifying campaign and have played eight qualifiers previously, all in a two-legged knockout format. They have drawn three and lost five.
