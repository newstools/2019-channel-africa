The Ugandan health ministry says one million people have had malaria in the past two months in that country. The ministry says there has been a 40% increase in reported cases compared to the same period last year. Officials say prolonged rainfall in June and the reduction in the use of mosquito bed nets are to blame. This time of the year is normally peak Malaria season but the prolonged June rains seem to have created an even more fertile breeding environment for the mosquitoes that transmit the infectious disease. Officials say there has been a reduction in the use of mosquito bed bets as those distributed in 2017 begin to age. Burundi, another West African country, is currently battling another Malaria epidemic with nearly 6 million people affected and more than 1 000 dead this year. In Burundi, the recent death of a six-year-old YouTube star from a malaria epidemic spotlighted the growing challenge of combating malaria in a warmer world, health experts said on Tuesday. Darcy Irakoze, known as Kacaman, who was popular for his comedy performances on YouTube and in local theatres, died last Thursday after contracting the mosquito-borne diseaseÂ  in his home city of Gitega, east of the commercial capital, Bujumbura. --BBC/Reuters--
