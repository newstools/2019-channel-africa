The local currency opened trade at R14.74 to the greenback and was changing hands at R14.86/$ at 11:45, down 0.5%. Earlier it fell to a low of R14.94/$ before strengthening briefly. "There seems so be no end in sight for the rand's woes as it continues to weaken," said Bianca Botes of Peregrine Treasury Solutions in a note to clients. "The trade war remains the focus point for the time being." Last week, United States (US) President, Donald Trump, threatened to impose additional tariffs on $300 billion worth of Chinese imports. This dealt a blow to emerging market currencies, including the rand, as risk sentiment diminished. Andre Botha of TreasuryONE said in a morning note that China appeared to be starting to play hardball with the US, which has sent the market towards safe-haven assets like gold and the Japanese Yen. "China let the Yuan weaken to its weakest level in more than a decade and asked State-owned companies to suspend imports of US agricultural products," he said.
