It follows a car bomb attack on Saturday in Benghazi which killed three UN staff. The truce involves the UN-backed Government of National Accord and the rogue general, Khalifa Haftar. His forces have been attacking the capital, Tripoli, since April. More than 1 000 people have died, according to the World Health Organisation. Haftar agreed to the truce "so that Libyan citizens can celebrate this Eid in peace", his spokesperson, Ahmad al-Mesmari, explained. The truce started on Saturday at 15:00 local time (13:00 GMT) and would last until the same time on Monday afternoon, the spokesman added. Eid al-Adha is the Muslim festival which commemorates when God appeared to Ibrahim in a dream and told him to sacrifice his son but before the sacrifice goes ahead, God provides a lamb to be sacrificed instead. The festival happens after the Hajj, the annual pilgrimage to the holy city of Mecca in Saudi Arabia.
