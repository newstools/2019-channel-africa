Omar Mohamud Mohamed's appointment follows the killing of his predecessor, Abdirahman Omar Osman, in a suicide bombing carried out by a female colleague last month. Nicknamed Finish, the new mayor was a warlord in Mogadishu until he became a Minister of Religious Affairs in Somali's then transitional government in 2004. He served in the post until 2009. State-owned Radio Mogadishu quoted the president as saying Mr Mohamed had been chosen because of his "experience" in government, and because he would continue to implement development projects.
