Reports from people on the Namibian bank say the reptiles appear to have been poisoned, then cut open, with their limbs removed. Namibia has laws against the killing of crocodiles, which are a tourist attraction. Romeo Muyunda, chief public relations officer for Namibia's Ministry of Environment, told BBC it was suspected the crocodiles were poisoned on the Angolan side. A meeting has been set up with the ministry's Angolan counterparts at the end of August to discuss the killings, he said. Namibian authorities suspect people on the bank could have killed the crocodiles in retaliation to an attack, Muyunda said. There might be people that were affected, maybe their livestock was killed by these crocodiles or maybe a person, a loved one, was killed by the crocodile and as a result, in fury, these people poisoned a carcass and used it as a bait for crocodiles to come and eat." Investigators will also explore whether the crocodiles were killed for their meat. --BBC--
