The government of veteran leader President Yoweri Museveni, 74, has long chafed at criticism from NGOs and others of reported excesses including corruption, torture, illegal detentions and extra-judicial killings. Over the last year several government officials have been quoted in local media accusing Bobi Wine, a musician-turned-legislator who says he will seek the presidency at the next election, of being funded by unnamed foreign agents. Steven Okello, executive director of the state-run National Bureau for NGOs, told Reuters the organization was undertaking a “verification and validation” exercise for all non-profits operating in the country and that this included filing of financial records. “We want more information about these organizations, their area of operation... We want also to establish do you have an approved budget, how much is that budget, and who is funding it,” Okello said. Uganda’s next presidential election is not due until early 2021 but Museveni, in power for 33 years, is widely expected to stand again. Livingstone Sewanyana, head of the Foundation for Human Rights Initiative (FHRI), told Reuters the renewed government scrutiny of NGOs was a concern ahead of the election. "It could have an intimidating effect and also have an overall negative impact on civic oversight of the poll," he said. This month a letter circulating on social media showed the head of the Financial Intelligence Authority, a government agency that tracks and combats money laundering, writing to a commercial bank requesting financial records of 13 pro-democracy NGOs including FHRI. The agency’s head, Sydney Asubo, did not reply to a Reuters call seeking comment, but Sewanyana told Reuters that FIA has confirmed to him they were seeking the information.
