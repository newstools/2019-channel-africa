Some economists have argued that the government could find itself approaching the IMF for funding to help prop up SA's ailing economy, which is buckling under the weight of prolonged poor growth, high unemployment and struggling state-owned entities. “We don’t have to get there.  These problems are within our grasp, we know exactly what must be done. We know the trade-offs that must be made, we must make those trade-offs,” Kganyago said during a dialogue with journalists on Thursday.

He added the government would need to to take bitter medicine in order to prevent matters from spiraling out of control. SA's struggling economy has been hit by several shocks, including multi billion-rand financial support packages extended by National Treasury to keep loss-making state-owned entities afloat, record high unemployment and low growth.

Official statistics show that South Africa’s GDP shrank by 3.2% in the first three months of the year, the biggest contraction in ten years.
