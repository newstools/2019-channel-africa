"Our main aim is to relieve pain from these women who are suffering from these cheaters, as a governor am not happy to lead women who are sad and heartbroken," Paul Makonda said at a press conference on Monday. He said the idea came to him after meeting many women who say men have cheated on them after he invited single mothers to his office last year. Makonda gave no details about the stage of the proposal and it isn't clear whether it is legally allowed or even technically possible. --BBC--
