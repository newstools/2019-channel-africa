Charles Sirleaf made the plea in a court in the capital Monrovia on Monday with four other central bank officials, AFP adds. Last year $15.5 billion Liberian dollars $104 million of freshly minted currency disappeared from Liberia's ports. Sirleaf, who was a deputy governor of Liberia's Central Bank, was charged with economic sabotage, criminal conspiracy and theft. Then last week he was charged with a further charge of money laundering. Specifically, he is accused of being involved in asking the Swedish printing company who printed the $104 million to print a further $16 million. --BBC--
