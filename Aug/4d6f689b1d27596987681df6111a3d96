Koepka earned the money by virtue of finishing first in the FedEx Cup standings and thanks to the Wyndham Rewards top 10, he also received a bonus cash. His first-place finish in the FedEx Cup standings earned him $2 million, while he also pocketed another $1 million for winning the season-long Aon Risk Reward Challenge, a competition that rewards golf's best strategic decision makers based on their handling of 65 specially designated challenge holes throughout the season. Alex Noren was the only golfer who could have challenged Koepka for the prize, but he needed two double-eagles on the 15th hole across four days at the Wyndham last week, which unsurprisingly failed to occur. Koepka wasn't the only player who earned money with his feet up, however. Eight of the top 10 in the final FedEx Cup standings weren't in the Wyndham field. --News24--
