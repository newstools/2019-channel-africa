Johaar told the portfolio committee on health the bill was certified on July 29. She said State law advisors viewed it not only as being in line with the Constitution but written to give effect to the right to access health care services enshrined in Section 27 of the Constitution. "Everyone has the right to access health care services this bill must then be regarded as a measure designed to give effect to a right enshrined in the constitution." The Democratic Alliance (DA) earlier this month called on Parliament to say whether the bill had been certified as unconstitutional. DA leader Mmusi Maimane said it was his view that the draft law may not pass constitutional muster, in part because it centralised health care services and eroded the powers of provinces in this regard. --ANA--
