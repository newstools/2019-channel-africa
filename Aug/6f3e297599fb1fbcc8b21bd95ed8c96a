Kyrgios was dominant on serve as he enjoyed his least stressful match of the tournament thus far. He was broken on service just once by Nishioka and won 85% of his first serves. Playing in his first tournament since his testy second round loss to Rafa Nadal at Wimbledon, Kyrgios will next face unseeded Slovakian Norbert Gombos. Top-seeded Stefanos Tsitsipas of Greece overcame an uneven performance to take down Australian Jordan Thompson 6-3 7-6(4). Tsitsipas trailed 5-4 in the second set but climbed out with some timely serves to ultimately prevail. “I made a lot of unforced errors in those break points, and getting to those break points, I played fantastic,” Tsitsipas told the Washington Post. “I played very brave and very smart, and suddenly I start thinking about it a bit too much, and that’s what happens. I make mistakes.” The 20-year-old Tsitsipas, who owns wins over both Roger Federer and Nadal this year, will now take on Frenchman Benoit Paire who outmatched fifth-seeded American John Isner 7-6(3) 6-3. --Reuters--
