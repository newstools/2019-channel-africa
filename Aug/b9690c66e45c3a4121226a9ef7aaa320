The gloomy data underscored the challenge for Japanese policymakers worried that prolonged weakness in external demand will drive a sharp economic downturn at home. Exports in July fell 1.6% from a year earlier, Ministry of Finance data showed on Monday, dragged down by China-bound shipments of car parts and semiconductor production equipment. 

That compared with a 2.2% decrease expected by economists. It marked the longest run of declines in exports since a 14-month stretch from October 2015 to November 2016. 

Yet there was some glimmer of hope for shippers, as export volume rose 1.5% in July year-on-year - the first positive reading in nine months. Separately, the Reuters Tankan survey showed Japanese manufacturers’ business confidence turned negative for the first time since April 2013 in August. “My impression is that the year-on-year rise in the export volume was slightly stronger than expected. That’s a positive as falling exports is the biggest issue faced by the Japanese economy,” said Taro Saito, executive research fellow at NLI Research Institute.
