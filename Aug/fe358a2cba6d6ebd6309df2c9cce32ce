According to the supersport.com website, the team left in two separate batches from Auckland to Buenos Aires over the weekend, the first batch containing Erasmus and much for the team for the clash while the rest followed on Saturday, with the side now getting down to business before heading to Salta on Thursday for the match. But with Erasmus’ team having their best chance in a decade to claim the Rugby Championship title, all indications are that he will select his strongest form side for the clash, and leave the experimentation to Loftus Versfeld next week when the sides meet again in a friendly encounter. This means the hopes of scrumhalf Cobus Reinach and flank Marcell Coetzee finding some game time are probably not going to be realised before Loftus. The same goes for loose forward Marco van Staden and utility back Dillyn Leyds, both playing Currie Cup at the moment, but both will probably feature in the Loftus clash in some capacity, in order to give them a shot at impressing the coach. But back to Salta and the mission the Boks are on this week. In essence it couldn’t be clearer. Win with a bonus point and secure the Championship outright, or win without a bonus point and look to points difference. Lose and watch it all slip away. --News24--
