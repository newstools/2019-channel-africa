Gavin Watson, 73, died when a car he was driving rammed into a concrete pillar, according to police. Police did not mention him by name but said in a statement that he "allegedly lost control of his vehicle" near Johannesburg's O.R. Tambo international airport. Formerly an anti-apartheid hero, Watson's name surfaced this year in an inquiry into entrenched state corruption. According to allegations at an on-going judicial probe, his company, formerly known as Bosasa, dished out monthly bribes to ex-president Jacob Zuma and some top state officials in exchange for lucrative government tenders. Bosasa's ex-chief operations officer, Angelo Agrizzi, told the inquiry in January this year that on one occasion Watson went to Zuma's private home and "personally brought" him the money. â€œWatson said he personally delivered it to Jacob Zuma, put the bag next to him," Agrizzi said. The judiciary inquiry is investigating a web of murky deals involving government officials, the wealthy Gupta family and state-owned entities during Zuma's nine-year tenure. Watson's company has also been linked to a $32 800 donation to President Cyril Ramaphosa's 2017 campaign to head the ruling African National Congress (ANC). Local media say Watson had been due to testify before a tax inquiry on Tuesday. --AFP--
