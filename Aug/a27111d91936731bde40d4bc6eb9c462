The match will be played on Saturday, September 7 at the Nkoloma Stadium in Lusaka, Zambia. Kick-off is at 15:00 (SA time). Ntseki has been entrusted by the South African Football Association (SAFA) to look after the senior men's national side in a caretaker capacity as a full-time replacement is sought to fill the void left by Stuart Baxter late last month. The Scotsman shocked the South African public by resigning as head coach after guiding Bafana Bafana to the 2019 Africa Cup of Nations (AFCON) quarter-finals in Egypt. In his first Bafana Bafana squad, Ntseki called up Percy Tau, captain Thulani Hlatshwayo, Dean Furman, Bongani Zungu, Themba Zwane and Sibusiso Vilakazi. After not making the AFCON squad, Eric Mathoho, Thato Mokeke, Keagan Dolly, Bradley Grobler and Lebogang Phiri are back in the Bafana Bafana mix.
