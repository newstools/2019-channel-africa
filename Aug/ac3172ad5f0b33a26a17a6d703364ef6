Murray rejected the offer of a wildcard for the tournament before also deciding to step back from the doubles in New York too. That decision was based upon a desire to turn his focus upon his attempts to return to his former level in singles – and Eurosport pundit Alex Corretja believes it is the correct one. “It is not going to make any difference for him and he can hurt himself or damage himself so I think it’s a good idea not to go to the US Open,” former world number two Corretja said. “Playing at the US Open is very demanding, all of a sudden to go there and play best-of-five, what’s the point? “If you win one match and then you go, okay, let’s say he wins two matches best-of-five and then he has to play the third round, nothing is going to change for him. “Once he gets the rhythm, maybe in Asia playing tournaments there or maybe at the end of the year, then he might be ready for next season. But going to the US Open, best of five and he needs to play these kind of guys [Novak Djokovic, Rafael Nadal, Roger Federer etc.] where it’s very difficult.” Corretja knows Murray well having been part of his coaching team between 2009 and 2011.
