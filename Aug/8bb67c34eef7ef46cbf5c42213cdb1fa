A military spokesman said the attack was carried out near Dolev, a settlement northwest of the Palestinian city of Ramallah. "Three people appear to be injured at the scene," the spokesman said, adding that troops were searching the area. Israeli news reports said the wounded were Israelis, and that Palestinians had thrown an explosive charge near a water spring popular with hikers in the hilly central region of the West Bank. The first reports came shortly after 10 a.m. Israel's Magen David Adom ambulance service said it was treating three people in "serious condition", including a46-year-old man, a 21-year-old man and an 18-year-old woman
