Samantha Kureya, popularly known as 'Gonyeti', was forcibly taken from her home by masked and armed men on Wednesday evening, beaten up and dumped, she told a local newspaper from her hospital bed. Kureya told a journalist from the Daily News in a video clip available online that three masked men broke open her bedroom door and pulled her out of bed. "I was only wearing a top and pants, and when I said 'Let me dress' I was slapped, and ordered to look down," she said, adding that she was dragged into a car with her face down. The Guardian reported that she was driven to "an unknown place" by her abductors. "They started saying: 'You mock the government and we have been monitoring you'. They told me to lie down and instructed me to start rolling on the ground. They would instruct me to roll from either side and each time I did, I would get beaten. They started stomping on my back," the 33-year-old said, according to the publication.
