Joselyne Mwiseneza said she does not know whether her husband, Eugène Ndereyimana, is dead or alive. The politician, who represented the opposition FDU-Inkingi party in the east of the country, went missing on 15 July. Mwiseneza said the authorities have not given her any news about him. “The children are too sad, they don’t know what’s going on, and they keep asking me where dad is gone. It is too hard for me,” Mwiseneza said. Victoire Ingabire, leader of FDU-Inkingi, says that Habarugira Jean Damascène who held the same position as Ndereyimana, also went missing in 2016. His body was later discovered. Ingabire, a vocal critic of the Rwandan government, has previously condemned the killing of opposition members. Her personal assistant, Anselme Mutuyimana, went missing on his way home in March 2019. His body was later found in a forest. The Rwandan government has previously denied accusations that they have been persecuting the opposition. --AFP--
