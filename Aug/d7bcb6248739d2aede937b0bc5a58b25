The move will regulate the trade in giraffes and their body parts under the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (Cites). The vote was overwhelmingly approved, although some countries opposed it. Giraffe numbers in Africa have fallen by 40% in the past 30 years, in what is being called a "silent extinction". The mammals are largely targeted for bushmeat but body parts are also used to make products including jewellery, bracelets and purses, the proposal stated. The motion came from the Central African Republic, Chad, Kenya, Mali, Niger and Senegal, where giraffe populations have been diminishing heavily. But there was resistance from southern African countries, including South Africa, Botswana and Tanzania, where giraffes have fared better. --bbc--
