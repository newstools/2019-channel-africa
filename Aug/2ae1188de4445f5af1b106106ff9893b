The 10 were convicted of charges including "terrorism and secession", the state's lawyer, Martin Luther Achet, told AFP. The sentence was confirmed by a lawyer for the separatists, Joseph Fru, who condemned what he called a "parody of justice". The defendants refused to recognise the right of the military tribunal in Yaounde to try them. Their lawyers have yet to say whether they will file an appeal. Ayuk Tabe, a charismatic 54-year-old computer engineer by training, was the first self-proclaimed President of "Ambazonia", a breakaway state declared in October 2017 in two English-speaking regions of the central African country. The government responded with a military crackdown. Attacks by both sides have left 1 850 dead, according to the International Crisis Group (ICG) think tank, while the United Nations says 530 000 people have fled their homes. English-speakers account for about a fifth of Cameroon's population of 24 million, who are majority French-speaking. Anglophones are mainly concentrated in two western areas, the Northwest Region and the Southwest Region, that were incorporated into the French-speaking state after the colonial era in Africa wound down six decades ago. --AFP--
