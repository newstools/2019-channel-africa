The Murrays partnered for the first time since the 2016 Rio Olympics, downed Frenchmen Nicolas Mahut and Edouard Roger-Vasselin 6-4, 6-7 (7/9), 10-5 to reach the last eight at the US Open tune-up event. "It was a good atmosphere," Andy Murray said. "It felt like there were some good points and quick reactions out there." Andy Murray is practicing singles and playing doubles as the former world number one, now ranked 222, continues his fightback from right hip surgery in January. The 32-year-old Scotsman feared he could be forced into retirement before the operation. He returned to the court in June but only in doubles while he rehabilitates. Andy departed Washington in tears from pain and frustration last year after a rain-delayed 3:00 am singles finish. "I am in a much better place than I was last year," Murray said. "Physically, I'm so much better now. To be competing again and pain-free is brilliant." The British duo trailed 5-2 in the decisive super-tiebreaker but steamrolled back by taking the last eight points, with Jamie Murray's service winner securing the victory. It was Andy who began the rally with a backhand winner and added backhand volley and drop volley winners on the two penultimate points. Murray declared Monday his hip has responded better than expected and he was "quite close" to a singles comeback, perhaps as soon as Cincinnati in two weeks. --News24--
