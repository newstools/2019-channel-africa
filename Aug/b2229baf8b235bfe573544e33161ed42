He made the confirmation at a media briefing in Johannesburg where he said stakeholders, including government departments, had reached an agreement on the impasse of the South African Broadcasting Corporation (SABC) blacking out of PSL matches. Mthethwa, his Communications counterpart, Stella Ndabeni-Abrahams, met with PSL chairperson Irvin Khoza, the SABC and MultiChoice in Cape Town on Thursday. No PSL soccer matches have been shown on the SABC since the beginning of the season in August. This after the SABC was expected to pay SuperSport R280 million for 144 matches per year for a period of five years. The SABC said it did not have the money. Mthethwa says that people will now be able to watch football. "We met with PSL, MultiChoice and SABC. We have an agreement now. We’ve dealt with the impasse so the games are going to be broadcast. Our people are going to be able to watch of their loved sport, which is football."
