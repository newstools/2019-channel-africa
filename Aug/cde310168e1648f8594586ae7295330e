According to media reports, there was a lot of commotion at bus station, where people were trying to board overcrowded vehicle as they attempted to leave so as not to be caught up in the curfew. It was declared last week by the separatists to protest against life sentences given to 10 of their leaders, including Sisiku Ayuk Tabe, the president of the self-proclaimed Anglophone state of Ambazonia, made up of the North-West and South-West regions. English-speaking Cameroonians say they are marginalised by the French-speaking majority. The Anglophone crisis started in 2016 when lawyers and teachers went on strike over attempts to impose French in schools and courts in the North-West and South-West. Some took up arms in 2017 and hundreds have been killed and more than 500 000 people forced from their homes in the crisis. --BBC--
