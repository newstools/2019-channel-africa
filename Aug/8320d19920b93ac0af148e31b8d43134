The 50-year-old Barbadian's contract was due to expire at the end of September this year and CSA confirmed on Sunday that it would not be renewed, and that Gibson had been let go along with his entire coaching team. CSA has instead changed its structures completely and is now looking to appoint a team director, who will serve under a director of cricket, who will serve under Moroe. It is a linear structure of hierarchy, with Moroe at the very top. Cricketing decisions, such as the employment of key cricketing personnel, can now be made by acting director of cricket Corrie van Zyl and signed off by Moroe without going to board level first. The role of the head coach has been dissolved and Gibson's responsibilities will now be taken up by the team director, who will be appointed by Van Zyl and signed off by Moroe. Sport24 on Monday morning revealed how the relationship between Gibson and Moroe had soured over the past few months, and South Africa's dismal performance at the 2019 World Cup provided CSA with enough ammunition to part ways with their coach. Moroe did confirm, though, that he had initially intended on keeping Gibson around until after the 2021 T20 World Cup.
