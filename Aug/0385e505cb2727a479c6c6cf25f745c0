The Alfred Dunhill Championship at Leopard Creek will launch the 49th European Tour season and the 2020 Race to Dubai from November 28-December 1. The Hong Kong Open at the Hong Kong Golf Club will take place in the same week as the Alfred Dunhill Championship. Those two events will be followed by the Mauritius Open (December 5-8) and the Australian PGA Championship (December 19-22) before the winter break. The South African Open (January 9-12) at Randpark Golf Club will kick off the new year in style. The SA Open will be followed by the Middle East Swing comprising the first Rolex Series event of the season, the Abu Dhabi HSBC Championship (January 16-19), followed by the Dubai Desert Classic (January 23-26) and the Saudi International (January 30-February 2). February begins in earnest with a return to Australia for the innovative Vic Open (February 6-9), where men and women will once again compete alongside each other at the same venue. The first two World Golf Championship events of 2020, the WGC-Mexico Championship (February 20-23) and WGC-Match Play Championship (March 25-29) then take place either side of the Oman Open (February 27-March 1), the Qatar Masters (March 5-8), the Magical Kenya Open (March 12-15) and the Indian Open (March 19-22), before the first Major Championship of the season, the Masters Tournament, at Augusta National (April 9-12). The full European Tour 2020 schedule, including the remainder of the Rolex Series events, will be announced later this year.
