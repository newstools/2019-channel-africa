SAFA are looking to fill the void left by Stuart Baxter, who resigned from the role two weeks ago, with Molefi Ntseki being appointed on an interim basis. Hunt has long been tipped as a future Bafana Bafana coach, having become the only man to win three consecutive Absa Premiership titles in history with SuperSport United between 2007 and 2010. And Hunt, who has been interviewed for the role before, believes it is an unnecessarily bureaucratic process and that SAFA should just hand-pick Baxter's successor. "For me, it should be left alone and let the powers that be handle the situation. They know who they want and what they want to do. I don’t think the guy they want should go for interviews," Hunt said as quoted by KickOff website. "I mean that position you should go for the person you want and then settle with him and then go from them. I think if we are going to do interviews, then you don’t know, especially when you interview the local guy. "I mean geez, there shouldn’t be too much you don’t know about the (local) guy. Whatever happens, must happen. There’s certainly been a lot of people talking in the media, that’s for sure."
