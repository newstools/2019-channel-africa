The donations come ahead of an official pledging conference planned for the end of October, with officials aiming to fix the exact dates and location at a meeting in Ottawa this week. At last weekend’s summit of powerful G7 nations, Britain, France and Canada announced fresh support for the Green Climate Fund (GCF), which backs projects to help developing states shift to clean energy and cope with wilder weather and rising seas. In the GCF’s first fundraising push in 2014 it received pledges of more than $10 billion. But US President Donald Trump, a climate change skeptic, later refused to deliver two-thirds of a $3-billion promise made by his predecessor, and currency fluctuations have also shrunk the GCF’s pot. Germany and Norway already announced in late 2018 they would double their initial contributions, and the new pledges from Britain and France are also twice what they first gave, when measured in their national currency. In a statement after the G7 summit, Yannick Glemarec, the fund’s executive director, said the doubling of contributions was “vital to support developing countries to raise and realize climate ambitions”. Many plans by developing nations to curb their planet-warming emissions - to help meet global goals to prevent runaway climate change - depend on such international assistance. France’s efforts to put the GCF replenishment high on the G7 agenda signal “the importance of the fund to drive transformative outcomes for countries and communities in the frontline of climate change”, Glemarec noted. The GCF has now allocated more than $5.2 billion to 111 climate projects in 99 countries.
