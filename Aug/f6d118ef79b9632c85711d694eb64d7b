The Pentagon said on Monday it had tested a conventionally-configured cruise missile that hit its target after more than 500 kilometres of flight, its first such test since the demise of a landmark nuclear pact in August.

Washington formally withdrew from the Cold War-era Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty (INF) on August 2 after accusing Moscow of violating it, a charge dismissed by the Kremlin. The pact had prohibited land-based missiles, reducing the ability of both countries to launch a nuclear strike at short notice. Putin told his Security Council on Friday that Russia could not stand idly by, and that US talk of deploying new missiles in the Asia-Pacific region “affects our core interests as it is close to Russia’s borders”. US Defense Secretary Mark Esper said this month he was in favor of placing ground-launched intermediate-range missiles in Asia relatively soon, and Putin complained this week that the United States was now in a position to deploy its new land-based missile in Romania and Poland.
