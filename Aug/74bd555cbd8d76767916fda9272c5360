The four are members of the Springbok training squad of 36 players who gathered in Bloemfontein on Sunday for the start of a four-day Rugby World Cup camp. 

They will join their provinces on Tuesday. Meanwhile, Springbok management has confirmed that Marcell Coetzee will undergo ankle surgery on Wednesday.  

The Ulster loose forward hurt his ankle and also suffered a blow to the head in the first half of the Springboks’ 24-18 victory over Argentina in Pretoria. He will be out of action for up to 12 weeks, which means he is also ruled out of contention for selection for the Springboks’ RWC squad. The Springbok RWC squad announcement takes place next Monday at 15:00 in Johannesburg.
