It is the first time the Soweto-born star has been ranked in the magazine's top 10. The 35-year-old raked in $28 million last year alone from various projects, including his day job as the television host of The Daily Show. But the bulk of his income came from his 70-stop world tour as a stand-up comedian, making him eligible for the list of richest stand-ups. Other sources of income were his two shows on Netflix, and book sales from his bestselling autobiography Born A Crime. While the funnyman leads African stand-ups in earnings, the number-one spot goes to United States comedian, Kevin Hart, who made an estimated $59 million in 2018.
