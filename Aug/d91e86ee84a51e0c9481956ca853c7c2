The course, called Modern Britain, will "study the crisis" as it happens, a notice shared on Twitter said. Students will, however, not sit for an exam. Bruce Bennett from the university confirmed to the BBC that the course will be offered. (It) is intended to link the present crisis, which is of interest to many people, to the historical background," he said. He said that as an elective course students from other departments would be able to take it: "There has been interest from students from across the university, including of course political science but not limited to them."
