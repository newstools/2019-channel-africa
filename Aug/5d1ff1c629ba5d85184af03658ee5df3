European markets had started higher, lifted by hopes for central bank and government stimulus measures, and for easing tensions in the China-US trade war. Trading floors have been on edge for weeks owing to a number of concerns including the trade war, Brexit, a global economic slowdown and tensions in the Middle East. Equities still got a positive start to the week, with Germany reportedly planning government support to avert a recession in Europe's biggest economy and central banks elsewhere looking to ease monetary policy. But on Tuesday investors worried mostly about Italy, where a political crisis was set to come to a head with speculation that Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte will resign after far-right Interior Minister Matteo Salvini withdrew his support from the dysfunctional coalition government. Italy is "the centre of attention", said Tangi Le Liboux at Paris-based brokerage Aurel BGC. --Reuters--
