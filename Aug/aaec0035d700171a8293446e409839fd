The clashes at the jail - home to about 1,700 prisoners - began after a guard accidentally dropped a tear gas grenade during routine rounds. According to STV, angry prisoners reacted by storming and setting fire to the jailâ€™s administrative offices, where documents relating to their cases were stored. The rioters also attacked the kitchen and health centre. The situation was only brought under control on Wednesday after the intervention of additional police units and the fire brigade. In addition to the three fatalities, four other prisoners were seriously injured and are currently undergoing treatment at the Central Hospital of Nampula. Two guards were slightly injured, and no prisoners escaped from the regional prison during the turmoil.
