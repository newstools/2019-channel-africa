At least 20 others were injured as thousands gathered at the entrance of a stadium to see a local rap star, Abderraouf Derradji, who is best known as “Soolking”. Details are sketchy about how the stampede broke out. The injured were evacuated to a nearby hospital. The concert, which went ahead, was televised live on an Algerian music Canal Algérie. Some tweeters posted clips from the concert.
