Last year $15.5 billion Liberian dollars ($104 million) of freshly minted currency disappeared from Liberia's ports. Charles Sirleaf, who was Deputy Governor of Liberia's Central Bank, was arrested over this and due to face trial for economic sabotage, criminal conspiracy and theft. He was arrested on Tuesday after state prosecutors added a further charge of money laundering to the accusations. Specifically, he is accused of being involved in asking the printing company who printed the $104 million to print a further $16 million. He has denied all wrongdoing. The Solicitor-General, Sayma Syrenius Cephus, told me that Sirleaf was released shortly after his arrest for health reasons. “We wanted him to be alive when we prosecute him,” he said.
