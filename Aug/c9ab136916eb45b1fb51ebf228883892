Baba's father, Deyda Hydara, co-founder of The Point newspaper and AFP's correspondent in The Gambia for 30 years, was revered among journalists in this small West African country. Baba Hydara, 42, has fought for years for his father's murderers and those who ordered them to be brought to book. Now the wall of silence around Jammeh's 22-year reign of fear is starting to crack, and information if not yet justice is starting to flow. The iron-fisted ruler, today aged 54, flew to Equatorial Guinea after being forced out in 2017 following an election defeat. His henchman are giving testimony to a Truth, Reconciliation and Reparations Commission tasked with shedding light on one of the grimmest episodes in West African history.Â 

Like the post-apartheid truth commission in South Africa that it emulates, the panel is gripping the public with its graphic evidence. "It brought back memories, something we've been through like almost 15 years ago it was very hard for the whole family," Baba Hydara told AFP, describing his feelings as he listened to the testimony of one of the killers, Malick Jatta. As a member of the "Junglers", as Jammeh's hit squad was called, Jatta admitted to being a member of a team that riddled Deyda Hydara with bullets on the evening of December 16, 2004.
