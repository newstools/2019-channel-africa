This breaks the truce during the Muslim festival Eid al-Adha agreed by the United Nations-backed Government of National Accord (GNA) and the rogue general, Khalifa Haftar, which started on Saturday afternoon. Forces loyal to General Haftar have been attacking the capital, Tripoli, since April but he agreed to the truce "so that Libyan citizens can celebrate this Eid in peace", his spokesperson Ahmad al-Mesmari explained earlier in the weekend. The truce started on Saturday at 15:00 local time (13:00 GMT) and he had promised they would last until the same time on Monday afternoon, the spokesperson added. The GNA blamed Haftar's forces for the attack against the airport, and for a separate alleged attack in the Soug al-Jomaa district of Tripoli, their spokesperson Mustafa al-Mejii is quoted as saying to AFP. "We have noted the coordinates of the rocket fire from zones controlled by Haftar's militias south of the capital", said Mejii. Haftar does not appear to have commented. Air traffic was suspended "until further notice" the airport's management said. --BBC--
