The National Treasury has asked departments to prepare proposals on how to reduce expenditure in a way that has the least impact on service delivery. It’s seeking cuts of 5% for 2020-21, and 6% and 7% for the next two years, the Treasury said. 

That could be as much as $19.7 billion over three years. This could be a first step in containing South Africa’s budget deficit, which is projected by Fitch Ratings to overshoot the government’s forecast by almost 2% points in 2019.  

Spending cuts of that magnitude could placate credit ratings companies such as Moody, the last major firm to assess South Africa’s debt at investment grade, and reduce the need for tax hikes. Moody’s communication desk said by email it could not immediately respond to queries about thi Finance Minister Tito Mboweni said in February the government will reduce its wage bill.

This would be done by encouraging early retirement. State workers’ salaries account for about 35% of the budget for the fiscal year that ends in March. Mboweni will present the mid-term budget statement with the spending framework for the next three years in October.
