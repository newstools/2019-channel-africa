Zimbabwe President, Emmerson Mnangagwa, has addressed the Defence Force Day celebrations in the capital, Harare, calling on Zimbabweans to cherish the relative peace that is currently prevailing in that country. Mnangagwa’s call comes as the opposition in that country prepares for much-anticipated nationwide mass demonstrations. Mnangagwa says citizens must stay vigilant and reject those who he claims wish to perpetuate violence and disunity. He has further urged the defence force to continue to be loyal to the country. In line with the planned protests for Friday, Zimbabwe’s main opposition, the Movement for Democratic Change, has invited Zimbabweans to join the party’s activists in demonstrations against alleged poor governance by Mnangagwa’s administration. However the police, government officials and war veterans have warned against taking part in the demonstrations, signaling a panic in the Zanu-PF camp. The planned protests are said to be intended to shake the ruling administration into cushioning the suffering Zimbabweans. --SABC/Simon Muchemwa--
