The 30-year-old Smith - who has scored two centuries and 92 in his three innings in the first two Tests - was felled by a Jofra Archer bouncer on Saturday in the first innings of the second Test at Lord's. Smith's absence will be a huge blow to Australia who hold a 1-0 lead in the five Test series and for whom victory at Headingley would ensure they retained the Ashes. Their other batsmen have not looked convincing - experienced opener David Warner has totalled just 18 in his four innings - with Smith being the lynch-pin. "When we followed the protocols he was probably a couple of days off being fit to be selected," said Langer at a press conference. "It was really a no-brainer. He felt a bit better yesterday but he's not going to have enough time to tick off everything he's got to do." Langer, who replaced Darren Lehmann as coach when the latter resigned following the ball-tampering scandal that blew up on the tour of South Africa in 2018, said losing Smith was as big a blow as England losing leading wicket taker Jimmy Anderson in the first Test. "It's not unlike England losing James Anderson. He's arguably their best bowler and we're going to lose arguably our best batsman for this Test match," said Langer. "It is always a blow. No doubt about that. When you take your best players out it always has an impact. "We have to make sure our senior players and the younger guys step up and fill what are almost unfillable shoes because he's the best player in the world." The team doctor Richard Saw had the final say on whether Smith played or not and he was seen speaking with him during team training on Tuesday.Â
