It says that more than 150 were killed between January and the end of June. Despite recent ceasefire deals between the government and armed groups, insecurity is deteriorating in the centre of the country. Most attacks in the area are believed to be perpetrated by armed militias. Recruitment of children to armed groups has doubled in comparison to the same period last year, says Unicef, which warns that extreme violence causes debilitating, long-term trauma in young people. The reports say other children were injured, displaced and separated from their families.

The UN's independent human rights expert on Mali said in his last report that childrenâ€™s rights violations were under-reported, and also voiced concern about a lack of protection for victims and witnesses. --BBC--
