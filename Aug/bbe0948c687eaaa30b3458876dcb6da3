Australia's Barty, 23, won the battle of former number one players in just over 90 minutes. The reigning Roland Garros champion beat five-time Grand Slam winner Sharapova, who was Cincinnati champion in 2011, for the second time this season after a win at the Australian Open. It was Barty's 40th victory of 2019 and she goes on to face either Poland's Iga Swiatek or Anett Kontaveit of Estonia.
