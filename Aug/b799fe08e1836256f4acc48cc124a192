Jumia owns clothing seller Zando in South Africa, and operates in 14 African companies, with some four million customers across the continent. It has uncovered instances of improper orders placed and subsequently cancelled to inflate sales in Nigeria, Bloomberg reported. Marketwatch reported that sales agents inflated the sales to earn additional commission. Some 4% of first-quarter sales, or sales worth $17.5 million, are believed to have been inflated, Jumia said. Quartz Africa reported that online retailer claimed the fraudulent orders have had no impact on its financial statements, and that the employees involved have since been suspended pending a review. Jumia was listed on the New York stock exchange in April, at a price of $18.95 - it soon climbed to almost $47. Following the news of the fraudulent sales on Wednesday, it fell from $14.75 to $12.21. But by Thursday early trading it recovered to around $13.00.Â
