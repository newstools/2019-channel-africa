Uganda Airlines’ inaugural flight to Nairobi on Tuesday carried mostly government and airline officials following a ceremony to re-launch the carrier that collapsed in 2001. Uganda Airlines owns two planes, with four more being ordered, including two Airbus jets. The carrier will fly to regional destinations such as the Somali capital, Mogadishu. Ugandan President, Yoweri Museveni, championed the revamped airline as a symbol of national pride, calling it “a new baby” in June. Authorities acknowledge the airlines faces challenges but hope it will survive as the East African nation becomes an oil producer. The airline is expected to face competition from carriers such as Kenya Airways, which operates regular flights between Nairobi and Entebbe. --AfricaNews--
