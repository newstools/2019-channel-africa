In July, the International Maritime Bureau described the Gulf of Guinea as the most dangerous area in the world for piracy with 73% of all sea kidnappings and 92% of hostage-takings taking place there. The army source declined to give details on the number and nationality of the hostages or the name of their ship. "I'm waiting until I know for sure," he said. "Was there an attack? Yes. Were hostages taken? Yes." The kidnapping was confirmed by the port source.  --AFP--
