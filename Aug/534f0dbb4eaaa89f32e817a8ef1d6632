DStv, which entered the Kenyan market in 1995, said in a notice to subscribers that it would from September 1 slash its monthly payments by between five and 30 %. The company’s move is seen as its latest bid to protect its customer base in the face of increasing competition as home Internet connections from providers such as Wananchi Group and Safaricom push up demand for on-the-go streaming services such as YouTube, Netflix and MultiChoice’s Showmax. “Our aim is to make great entertainment accessible to more consumers in Kenya and we believe this move will grant more of our customers access to the complete world of exciting entertainment channels at a lower price,” said MultiChoice Kenya in a statement. Subscribers on the Premium, which is its most expensive tariff plan, will now pay $75 down from $79 per month, reflecting a five per cent drop. Compact Plus users will now part with $45 a month down from $52 representing a 13.46 % cut. --TheEastAfrican--
