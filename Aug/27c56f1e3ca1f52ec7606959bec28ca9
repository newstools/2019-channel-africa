The airline attributed the 112 % widening of loss to increased operating costs in the wake of its expansion into new routes and the return of two Boeing 787 planes that had been sub-leased to Oman Air. The company’s revenue jumped by 12.1 % to $565 million in the period, from $502 million in the first six months of last year. Similarly, costs jumped 15.4 % $593.4 million in the period from $514 million last year, eating into the carrier’s margins. “In turning around Kenya Airways, a deliberate decision was taken not to shrink the airline but instead improve financial performance through strategic investments on growth opportunities,” said board chairman Michael Joseph after announcing the results in Nairobi on Tuesday. “Some of these investments may deny KQ and its shareholders an immediate return but are expected to yield positive results in the future.”  --TheEastAfrican--
