The former captain was not considered for their last match against the Wallabies because of a shoulder injury. He replaces Julian Montoya who drops to the bench. There will also be a new lock pairing with Matias Alemanno and Marcos Kremer replacing Guido Petti and Tomas Lavanini, while Javier Ortega Desio comes in for Tomas Lezana at flank. The only change in the backline sees Emiliano Boffelli return at fullback in place of Joaquin Tuculet. The Springboks top the table on seven points, one ahead of the All Blacks, and a bonus point victory in Salta will guarantee the Boks their first Rugby Championship title in a decade. --SABC Sport--
