Ducati's Andrea Dovizioso, winner of this race in 2017, is 63 points behind the Spaniard whose Honda has taken the chequered flag in the last two races in Germany and the Czech Republic. Another Marquez victory in Austria - he already has six out of 10 so far this season - and Dovizioso can all but kiss goodbye to the title even though there are a further eight races to come. "The Red Bull Ring is an excellent track for us, this is clear from the results achieved there in the last few years," said the 33-year-old Italian who is still searching for his first world title. "But as I'm always saying, each race has its own story to tell. Last year Márquez finished ahead of me, so I’m sure that this year he will again be competitive." The Ducatis will certainly give the Hondas a good race although the speed of the bikes of Dovizioso and Jack Miller, who finished second and third in Brno on Sunday, cannot compensate for a lack of agility on the turns. But the Austrian circuit is fast and the record top speed of 316.5 km/h which they set in 2017 could be beaten. Marquez, though, who has never won in Austria, will be well aware that the course requires a lot of braking, one of the strengths of his Honda. --News24--
