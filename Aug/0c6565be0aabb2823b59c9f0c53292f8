The 35-year-old French driver had only penned a one-year deal with Citroen for the current campaign and had hinted that he was closing in on a farewell. "There are still 20 rallies left for me to race if you are counting down," Ogier told the Rally of Finland website. "But it's not as if I have it in my mind that I am going to drive more slowly." Ogier is currently in second place in this year's championship, four points behind leader, Estonia's Ott Tanak in a Toyota with six rounds left in 2019, including this weekend's event in Finland. Ogier, who has said he wants to spend more time with his family while also becoming an ambassador for the new Formula Extreme-E series, made his world rally debut in 2009.  --AFP--
