While the rand pulled back from a near 11-month low, the outlook remains less than rosy as the International Monetary Fund cautioned yesterday that public debt is approaching uncomfortable levels.

At the close of local trade, the rand quoted 0.56% stronger at R15.27/$, after trading in range of R15.21/$ - R15.43/$.Â 

The local unit extended gains during the Asian trading session this morning. Expected range today R15.05/$ - R15.40/$.
