The company and Sierra Leone's President Julius Maada Bio launched the virtual ID platform in the capital, Freetown, on Wednesday. Kiva provides microloans in 80 countries.The system will use bio-metric data such as fingerprints to provide lenders access to citizenâ€™s credit histories. A borrower seeking a loan will be assigned a digital wallet which will record the transactions on a public blockchain. However, prospective borrowers will have to use Internet to access the platform. Some 15% of the population in Sierra Leone has access to the Internet. Identity is a problem in Africa as children in numerous countries on the continent are born but never registered.
