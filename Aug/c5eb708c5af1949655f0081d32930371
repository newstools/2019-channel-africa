The conference will take place in the central district of Gorongosa, according to US-based news outlet Voice of America (VOA). VOA interviewed dissident General Mariano Nhongo, who said that some of the senior generals loyal to Renamo's late leader, Afonso Dhlakama, have either been killed or isolated somewhere in captivity as punishment for not being in favour of Momade. He said this was why the dissidents had decided to dethrone him. The official Renamo leadership describes General Nhongo and other senior dissidents as "undisciplined deserters", and insists that the demobilisation of the Renamo militia, as agreed in a recent peace deal between Momade and President Filipe Nyusi would go ahead as planned. --AFP--
