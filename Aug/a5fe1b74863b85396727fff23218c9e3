The company said a price war in the United States was easing and that an important measure of profitability topped its target, but slowing revenue growth raised questions about Uber’s ability to expand and fend off competition. “Losses are widening and the competition is cut-throat,” said Haris Anwar, analyst at financial markets platform Investing.com. “What’s sapping investor confidence and hitting its stock hard after this report is the absence of a clear path to grow revenue and cut costs.” Uber’s second-quarter net loss, widening from a loss of $878 million a year earlier, included $3.9 billion of stock-based compensation expenses related to its IPO earlier this year and nearly $300 million in “driver appreciation” related to the stock sale. The report caught investors off guard in part because Uber’s smaller rival Lyft Inc on Wednesday had raised revenue expectations and described an easing price war. Uber stock had risen more than 8% and Lyft had gained 3% during the day. Following Uber’s report, its shares fell 6% and Lyft dropped nearly 2%. Uber reported that revenue growth slowed to 14% to $3.2 billion and fell short of the average analyst estimate of $3.36 billion, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. The company’s core business, ride-hailing, grew revenue only 2% to $2.3 billion. Food delivery Uber Eats grew 72% to $595 million. --Reuters--
