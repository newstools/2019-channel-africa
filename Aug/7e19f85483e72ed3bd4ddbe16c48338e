The payment relates to the supply of Fludrocortisone and Dexamethasone.

The group said the payment would be made to different institutions, with the UK secretaries of state for health and social care receiving $7.86 million. It said it would also pay $955 000 to the Scottish ministers, $552 000 to the Welsh and the departments of Health and Social Services, and $328 000 to the Department of Public Safety for Northern Ireland. The group said it had offered commitments to the CMA for the purposes of addressing the competition concerns arising from certain aspects of the CMA’s investigation. Aspen Pharmacare shares closed 6.66% lower at R69.55 (JSE($4.55) on the JSE yesterday. The UK CMA opened an investigation into Aspen’s alleged anti-competitive conduct under Articles 101 and 102 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union in relation to the supply of Fludrocortisone acetate 0.1mg tablets and Dexamethasone 2mg tablets in the UK. Aspen said CMA advised Aspen that it would not be proceeding with its investigation in relation to Dexamethasone. Under the terms of the commitments, Aspen will dispose of its rights to Fludrocortisone in the UK to an independent third party overseen by the CMA and Aspen. Aspen has been continuing with its strategy of exiting non-core assets after Mylan exercised its option to buy its portfolio for a maximum consideration of $130 million in May. The group said it would use the proceeds to reduce its debt. Aspen’s total debt was about R53.5 billion ($3.52 billion) by the end of December last year. --BusinessReport--
