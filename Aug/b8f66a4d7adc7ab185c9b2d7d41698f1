Speaking at the G7 summit in France, Roch Marc Christian Kaboré also said that to bring peace to Africa's Sahel region, international partners needed to invest in development as well as in a military solution. Since the overthrow of Libya's long-time leader Muammar Gaddafi nine years ago, weapons looted from the North African nation have been used by jihadists and militias across the Sahel region and the insecurity is getting worse every month. President Kaboré said that if Libya was stabilised then the international fight against the Islamist militants would be more effective. Mr Kaboré called for the counter-terrorism force operating in the region, known as the G5, to be properly funded. The mission has been undermined by a shortage of funds and a lack of training and equipment. Last week, at least 24 soldiers were killed in the north of Burkina Faso when jihadists stormed a military base.
