The Japanese auto giant, maker of the Prius and Camry models, will pay $907 million for 4.94% of Suzuki. Toyota and Suzuki had in 2017 signed a memorandum of understanding to discuss an operational tie-up. The announcement comes as the global auto business undergoes dynamic changes, brought on by tougher environmental regulations, and new market entrants such as tech firms developing driverless vehicles. These new factors posed "a turning point unprecedented in both scope and scale" for the business, the two firms said in a joint statement. By teaming up, they will tackle "this transitional era" to promote tie-ups in new fields like autonomous vehicles. Toyota offered engineering prowess, such as hybrid technology, while Suzuki, which enjoys enormous successes in India, has voiced concerns about staying competitive on its own. Toyota is among the world's biggest automakers, boasting brands like Lexus, but also small-car producer Daihatsu and truck maker Hino. In 2017, Toyota signed a capital alliance with smaller rival Mazda. Toyota is also the biggest shareholder of automaker Subaru. --AFP--
