Domingo is among the names on the BCB's shortlist which also includes former New Zealand mentor Mike Hesson, ex-England assistant Paul Farbrace and Grant Flower, who was until recently Pakistan's batting coach. It is believed that former England coach Andy Flower has already turned down an offer to coach the Asian team after Bangladesh sacked Englishman Steven Rhodes after last month's Cricket World Cup. The BCB's media committee chairperson Jalal Yunus confirmed that they have already conducted an interview with Domingo and they were impressed with the professionalism of the South African. In quotes published on ESPNCricinfo, Yunus said: "We have started working with our shortlisted coaches. We have just conducted an interview with Russell Domingo, the former South Africa coach. He is a real professional. "He is well qualified. He gave us a presentation about what he thinks about Bangladesh cricket. It was satisfying for the BCB. We will interview the rest of the coaches on our shortlist. We have two more to interview in the next few days, and then we will choose between these coaches." Domingo coached South Africa from 2013-2016 with the Proteas reaching the semi-finals of the 2015 World Cup under his guidance. He is currently in charge of the South Africa 'A' team.
