Masandawana suffered a 2-1 defeat in the first leg of their CAF Champions League, preliminary round fixture, but did manage to claim what could turn out to be a crucial away goal, thanks to Thapelo Morena. However, they will be without the services of inspirational captain Hlompho Kekana after his sending off in Congo. It has been a busy month for the Brazilians and, after being held to a 1-1 draw by Benni McCarthy's Cape Town City in a midweek Absa Premiership clash, Mosimane has highlighted the importance of getting an early goal. "We should be able to score a goal or two on Saturday. It won't be easy‚" Mosimane was quoted as saying by TimesLIVE. "We have to break the ice but if we get an early goal it will be much easier because they will be forced to come out and try and play. "They are going to be dangerous at set-pieces so we must make sure we have the right height in our team too." He continued: "They are strong‚ physical boys from central Africa and they will come here to park the bus and sit on their lead. "We are going to have to work out a way to get around that. "But we played well against them when we were 10 against 11 (in Congo). We had a lot of possession and managed to score when we were a man down." Kick-off is at 19:00.'
