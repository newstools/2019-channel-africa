Adjusted earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) were $5.58 billion for the six months ended June 30 against $8.18 billion a year earlier. The company’s shares were trading nearly 2% lower by 1139 GMT, recovering slightly from losses that took them to their weakest since October 2016. Chief Executive Ivan Glasenberg blamed “a challenging economic backdrop for our commodity mix” and setbacks during the ramp-up of operations in Africa. Glencore stands apart from other diversified miners because of its high-profile trading division and an appetite for risk that in the past has appealed to investors. It initially rebounded strongly from the commodity crash of 2015-16. But cobalt, which was meant to be part of Glencore’s strategic advantage as the world switches to electrification, has become a liability. Supplies are concentrated in the Democratic Republic of Congo, where Glencore is in a dispute with the government over a mining law. It is also subject to a U.S. Department of Justice investigation. Explaining the rationale for placing the Mutanda copper and cobalt mine in the DRC on “care and maintenance” from the end of this year for an expected two years, Glasenberg said there was “a mix” of reasons, including DRC’s revised mining code, which Glencore is challenging. Above all, Glasenburg said the mine’s economic viability had deteriorated because of low cobalt prices, poor access, increased costs and higher taxes.
