The listing of Anselem Sanyatwe, the first over the crackdown, signals US frustration over the lack of accountability in the August 1, 2018 killings in the capital, Harare. The announcement brought fresh anger from a Zimbabwe administration that since the fall of longtime leader Robert Mugabe in late 2017, has pressed to lift US sanctions over past rights abuses. “It is our position that sanctions imposed on our country are illegal,” said government spokesperson, Nick Mangwana. He said President Emmerson Mnangagwa has adopted a policy of rapprochement with the West “but that policy is not a policy of appeasement.” Sanyatwe is the first Zimbabwean official listed for US sanctions since Mugabe stepped down under military pressure. The former general and his wife are now barred from traveling to the US. Soldiers last year were deployed to suppress a protest against delays in announcing results of Zimbabwe’s first election without Mugabe on the ballot. The US statement said it has “credible information” that Sanyatwe was involved. The election had been peaceful, giving many people hope that the southern African nation was on the brink of change. Mnangagwa, who took over after Mugabe and was declared the election winner, had promised sweeping post-Mugabe reforms and re-engagement with the West. Sanyatwe later defended the soldiers’ deployment while appearing before a commission of inquiry into the killings, but denied the army shot the protesters and instead accused the opposition. He later retired from the army and was appointed ambassador to Tanzania. --AP--
