Equity released the figures after Zimbabwe Finance Minister, Mthuli Ncube, suspended the publication of these figures until February 2020 arguing that adoption of a new currency had impacted the base for calculating the consumer price index, Zim Live reported. Zimstat said on Wednesday that the countryâ€™s month-on-month inflation rate had fallen to 21.04% in July compared to 32.96% the previous month as prices of basic goods increased at a slower pace. Annual inflation hit 175.66% in June, the highest rate since runaway money-printing and associated hyperinflation forced the country to abandon its currency in 2009. --ANA--
