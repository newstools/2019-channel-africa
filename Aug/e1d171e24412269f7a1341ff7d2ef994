The Congo River basin forest region is one of the largest in the world after the Amazon and, like the South American rain forests, it plays a vital role in absorbing global carbon emissions. Along with illegal logging, the forest is threatened by the production of charcoal, a key energy resource for inhabitants because of the lack of electricity supplies. "Given that more than 90 % of the energy consumed in the DRC comes from wood, the lack of programmes to deliver clean and renewable energy is a direct threat to our forests," Tshisekedi said at an energy forum on Tuesday. "At the current pace of population growth and energy demands, our forests risk extinction by 2100." The Congo basin forest covers two thirds of the country or around 1.5 million kilometres square. --TheEastAfrican--
