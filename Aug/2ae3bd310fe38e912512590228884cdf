This after the Pretoria High Court found in January 2018 that he had "enriched" himself unlawfully from the Eskom Pension Fund, labour union Solidarity said in a statement on Wednesday. In an order dated July 29, the apex court stated that Molefe's application for leave to appeal should be dismissed as "it does not engage this court's jurisdiction and, in any event, bears no reasonable prospects of success". The Pretoria High Court and the Supreme Court of Appeal had both previously ruled that Molefe was unlawfully awarded an early retirement pension benefit after his resignation from the power utility in 2016. The former Eskom CEO then petitioned the Constitutional Court in June 2019 for leave to appeal the rulings of the lower courts.
