La Viola reportedly submitted an offer to take the 18-year-old striker on loan for the season with the option to make the move permanent for $1.8 million at the end of the campaign. The Premier League club have rejected Fiorentina's offer as the bid falls way below their valuation of the youngster, and the Reds have no intention of cashing-in on Duncan unless the Italian outfit significantly raise their offer. Liverpool may be tempted to allow Duncan to leave on loan with no option for a permanent exit as he is unlikely to challenge for any first-team action this season at Anfield. However, the Merseyside outfit would want assurance over game time and Fiorentina could struggle to provide those guarantees. --News24--
