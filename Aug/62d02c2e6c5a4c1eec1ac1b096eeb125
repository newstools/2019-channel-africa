The group consists of players who were part of the Springboks’ recent successful Rugby Championship campaign and the 'Farewell Test' against Argentina in Pretoria. The camp is designed to refocus the group on the World Cup campaign. The announcement of the 31-man squad takes place on Monday, August 26, at 15:00 in Johannesburg. Apart from a few team building exercises, the Springbok coaches and conditioning staff will put the training squad through some field sessions and a series of technical activities as the Boks continue to refine their plan for Japan. Four players who were part of the match-23 that played against Argentina in Pretoria on Saturday, were released back to their provinces for Currie Cup duty. The four are the Western Province trio of Wilco Louw (prop), Scarra Ntubeni (hooker) and Dillyn Leyds (wing), as well as Blue Bulls loose forward Marco van Staden. Ulster loose forward Marcell Coetzee, who went off early against the Pumas with a head knock and ankle injury, did not travel to Bloemfontein. The Springbok group will have a few closed practice sessions in the Free State capital before breaking camp on Thursday, after which the 31-man squad will then gather in Johannesburg for the official announcement of the RWC squad.
