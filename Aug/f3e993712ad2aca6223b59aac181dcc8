There was no evidence in the report that Huawei executives in China were aware of what was happening in Africa. Huawei described the allegations as "unfounded and inaccurate". Ugandan government spokesperson Ofowno Opondo told BBC Focus on Africa T that they were "false". "In Uganda we run a transparent democratic system. The opposition politicians speak their mind openly, there is no need to use underhand methods to find out what they are saying." When challenged that Uganda had been accused of spying on opponents in the past, Opondo said, "There will always be bad apples in the system." In 2015, the BBC reported that the Ugandan government used surveillance technology which was deployed to crush and potentially blackmail opponents. The report was denied by the government at the time. Bobi Wine has been an MP for two years and portrays himself as a champion of the poor, and sings about social justice and democracy.
