The warning puts the IMF at odds with Finance Minister Mthuli Ncube, who said in an interview he’s in favour of boosting wages in both the public and private sectors to restore living standards and create consumer demand. Ncube is looking for ways to revive an economy that’s forecast to contract this year for the first time in a decade. In the six years to 2016, Zimbabwe boosted pay for its about 400 000 civil servants to a level that makes up more than 90% of tax revenue, compared with 40% in 2010, said Patrick Imam, the IMF’s resident representative. "The government wage bill is now on a sustainable footing," he said in response to questions. "Looking ahead, it is crucial that public wage growth be aligned with economic growth and government revenue." In February, the government said a quasi-currency known as bond notes, and RTGS$ in their electronic form, would no longer trade at parity with the US dollar and in June it reintroduced the Zimbabwe dollar, which it had abolished in 2009 after a bout of hyperinflation. It also banned the use of the American currency. --News24--
