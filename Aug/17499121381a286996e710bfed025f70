Samuel Wazizi, who works for private music station CMTV presenting a TV talk show, was detained on Friday by police in Muea in one of Cameroon’s two English-speaking provinces. He is accused of collaborating with secessionists who are fighting to create an independent state called Ambazonia, made up of the North-West and South-West regions. Ewule said his client was initially denied bail as the police said the case was linked to terrorism. After five days, Wazizi was taken into custody of the military and since then he has not been able to talk to his client, he said. "I have not gained access to him; family members have not gained access to him. I went there and I was told that lawyers are not allowed in the military camp," the lawyer told BBC Focus on Africa reporter Randy Joe Sa’ah. Ewule said his client had not been formally charged but was accused of spreading separatist propaganda after his phone was searched. But having such information "was part of his journalism", he said. Our reporter says it is not the first time journalists in the Anglophone regions of Cameroon have been arrested for allegedly having literature linked to the separatists, who complain of being marginalised for decades by the central government and the French-speaking majority. "When you try to write a report critical of the government side, you're regarded as an enemy, as being on the side of the Ambazonians," Meriline Ngwa, a journalist in the South-West, told the BBC. According to the Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ), Cameroon jails the highest number of journalists in Africa after Egypt and Eritrea, with several imprisoned because of their work since the secessionist uprising began in 2017. --BBC--
