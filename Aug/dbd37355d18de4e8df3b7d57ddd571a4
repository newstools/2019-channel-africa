In passing the judgement, the Judge President says this is in terms of the Equality Act. The display of the apartheid at Black Monday protests constituted hate speech, harassment and unfair discrimination in terms of the Equality Act, rules Judge Mojapelo. According to Mojapelo, the judgment is a carefully guided prohibition, not a ban. The Nelson Mandela Foundation brought the matter to court, stating that the display of the flag amounts to hate speech and unfair discrimination against Black South Africans. But lobby group, AfriForum, challenged the move, saying it will violate freedom of speech. In passing his judgment, Mojapelo said one expects AfriForum to live up to its own words and help build an inclusive South Africa.
