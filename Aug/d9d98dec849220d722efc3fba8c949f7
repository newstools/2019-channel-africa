Only seven women are part of the cabinet out of a total of 43 people. Four of those seven are in junior positions. Critics are calling out President Muhammadu Buhari for breaking a previous promise on female representation. In 2015 he promised at least 35% of appointments at federal level would be given to women. The situation is also similar in the legislature at the federal level, with just seven women in the Senate and 11 women in the House of Representatives.
