The post of IMF managing director goes to a European by convention while an American heads the World Bank. "At this stage, although some candidates' names gather more support than others, there is not yet a full consensus around one name," the ministry, which is spearheading efforts to find a replacement for France's Lagarde, told reporters in a message. 

The post became vacant after Lagarde was tapped by EU leaders to head the European Central Bank (ECB). Several names, including Spain's Finance Minister Nadia Calvino and former Dutch Finance Minister, Jeroen Dijsselbloem, and Bank of England governor Mark Carney, have been floated as possible successors.

The name of current ECB Chief, Mario Draghi, had also been bandied about but he said last week he was "not available" for the position. At 71, he is also too old to hold the post, according to IMF rules, which state that the Managing Director must be under 65 when appointed.  

French Finance Minister, Bruno Le Maire, who is leading the talks on finding a candidate, has spoken to "all his colleagues" over the last few days, "in particular with Olaf Scholz", his German counterpart, his office said.

He has organised a conference call with his EU counterparts on Thursday "to update them on the latest developments following his extensive consultations, and to agree on the process to reach a consensus around one name," it added.
