The Zambian government started liquidation proceedings for Konkola Copper Mines (KCM) in May after it accused Vedanta of breaching the terms of its mining licence. Vedanta denies the allegations. The Zambian government has a 20% stake in KCM. The government and Vedanta are currently locked in a legal dispute over the future of KCM. Vendanta chairperson Anil Argawal met President Lungu in an attempt to resolve the situation. “The Vedanta chief expressed his desire to continue running the mine and, among other things, to pay the debt owed to suppliers and contractors, and to reinvest in the mine and restructure the shareholding of Konkola Copper Mines," Isaac Chipampe, the president’s spokesperson said in a statement. “The president stated that the position that the government has taken has the support of the people of Zambia, and the meeting will not affect the ongoing liquidation process," the statement said. --BBC--
