Kolisi, the flank forward, has recently fully recovered from a knee injury. Despite the initial plan being building for the 2023 Rugby World Cup when Erasmus took over, the 28-year-old Kolisi, together with the rest of the Springboks squad, believes that they have quite a good chance to win the William Web Ellis trophy. He adds that they are also with those players who missed out on the World Cup squad in spirit. The Springboks will play against Japan next Friday, their last warmup match before their first game of the tournament against New Zealand. Following their last World Cup shock defeat at the hands of Japan, Kolisi says they are taking things one match at a time.
