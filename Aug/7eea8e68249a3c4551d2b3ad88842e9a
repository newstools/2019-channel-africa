The Air Tanzania plane was prevented from taking off from Johannesburg due to a court injunction. A lawyer had argued in court that a retired farmer was owed at least $13 million in compensation after his land was seized by the Tanzanian government in the 1980s. Tanzanian authorities acknowledge that the farmer is owed money but their lawyer believes South Africa has no jurisdiction over the dispute. The court in Johannesburg has yet to rule on the case. --BBC--
