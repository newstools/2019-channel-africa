Bafana Bafana, coached on the day by David Notoane, were forced to field a young, makeshift side because the fixture clashed with the opening round of the Absa Premiership and clubs refused to release stars. However, after losing only 3-2 away in the first leg of a second round tie last weekend, South Africa were expected to secure an overall victory and book a date with Zimbabwe. Instead, Lesotho held South Africa until half-time, then Jane Thaba Ntso scored twice and Hlompho Kalake once to give the visitors a 6-2 aggregate triumph. The embarrassing loss completed a chaotic week for South African football with England-born national coach Stuart Baxter quitting two days ago. "I feel that I cannot continue to work with the required professionalism and passion," was the parting shot of a 65-year-old who achieved only eight wins in 21 matches. National under-17 coach, Molefi Ntseki, has been named caretaker coach while locals Pitso Mosimane, Gavin Hunt and Benni McCarthy have been tipped as possible full-time replacements. Before Baxter left, former star Mlungisi 'Professor' Ngubane slammed national football body President, Danny Jordaan, accusing him of treating the national team "as if it were his club". The Nations Championship is restricted to footballers playing in their country of birth. Previous editions have been won by the Democratic Republic of Congo (twice), Tunisia, Libya and Morocco.
