In an open letter to shareholders, the pan-African investment, savings, insurance and banking group said it was "clearly in the best interests of the company and its stakeholders that the employment relationship with Moyo should come to an end". "For this reason, Old Mutual has now given Moyo a further notice terminating his employment," the company said in the letter published on its website. "This step, as with previous steps taken in relation to Moyo, has been taken after legal advice and on careful reflection by directors, with proper regard to their fiduciary duties to the company. We must accept that Moyo may decide to challenge this step too. We will stand our ground if he does, naturally and at all times continuing to respect the law and our court system." --ANA--
