Els is the latest star to join the star-studded line-up, which includes world No 13 Tommy Fleetwood, former United States Open champion Graeme McDowell, two-time Alfred Dunhill Links champion Tyrrell Hatton and former world No 1 Lee Westwood. The tournament is played over three links courses - the Old Course at St Andrews, Carnoustie and Kingsbarns. The event has two separate competitions - an individual professional tournament for the world's leading golfers and the team championship, in which the pros are paired with amateur players, creating a unique atmosphere and camaraderie. Some of the amateur celebrities who have confirmed their participation include sporting greats like Kevin Pietersen, Ruud Gullit, Sir Steve Redgrave, Jamie Redknapp, Shane Warne and Jacques Kallis. This will be the 35th year that Alfred Dunhill has supported golf at St Andrews. "I've always loved the Old Course, and the town, ever since I played the Links Trophy as an amateur. There are places in the town where there are pictures of guys sitting on the Swilken Bridge with the Dunhill trophy. I've come so close, I would love to have my picture up there as well," said Fleetwood, who finished runner-up twice. The Alfred Dunhill Links Championship gets underway on the European Tour from September 26-29. Â
