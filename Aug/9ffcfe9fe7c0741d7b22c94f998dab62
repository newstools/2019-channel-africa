The Irish company, Tullow, which originally discovered the oil, has tried to sell most of its stake to state-owned Chinese firm CNOOC and French oil giant Total, but the deal collapsed after the companies failed to secure an agreement on tax relief from Uganda's Revenue Authority. Tullow discovered proven reserves of more than a billion barrels of oil around Lake Albert in 2006, but the resources have yet to be developed. Uganda wanted bigger companies involved and by 2012 CNOOC was a partner in the project, alongside Total. Tullow, which has developed significant offshore reserves in Ghana and has just started pumping oil in Kenya, decided to sell most of its one third stake in Uganda's oil to the French and Chinese companies. But the failure to agree on any tax due by CNOOC and Total has forced the sale to be shelved. It's not known if Tullow will try to find a different buyer and it's uncertain if it means yet another delay to Uganda finally exporting oil, 13 years after it was first discovered. Total has said it's still open to exercising its rights to buy Tullow Oilâ€™s share of the Ugandan project. Meanwhile the government says any future sale must abide by the law covering tax payments. --BBC--
