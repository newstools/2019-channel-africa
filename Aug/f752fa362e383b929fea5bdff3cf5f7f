Joe Thloloe says the audit should focus particularly on Nothando Maseko and Sebolelo Ditlhakanyane who have since resigned as well as Charles Matlou. Thloloe released the report at the public broadcaster’s offices Auckland Park offices. He also found that between 2012 and 2017, SABC executives took instructions from people without authority in the newsroom. Thloloe says they found that Ditlhakanyane, Maseko and Nyana Molete were pivotal in the execution of instructions from the former SABC Chief Operations Officer, Hlaudi Motsoeneng, among other executives. "Motsoeneng’s instruction to Human Resources to institute disciplinary hearings against employers, dismiss, promote or appoint others must be reviewed. Also, Human Resources should do an audit of the appointments, promotions or sideways shifts of senior management."
