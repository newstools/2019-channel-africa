Ledwaba was speaking at the SAFA Organised Women in Sports Conversation which was also titled #ItsUpToMe and attended by various women in sports leaders from different sporting codes. With the NWL kicking-off this weekend, SAFA also invited the key stakeholders, especially from the business side and Ledwaba, who is leading the project of the new league has outlined the idea behind this.

Ledwaba says this new NWL will see some competitive football in women’s football and this would also raise the standard of women’s football in the provincial Sasol women’s league.

The lack of financial support seems to be a challenge in women sports generally in the country and it’s a point that SAFA President Danny Jordaan was driving home. The Spanish La Liga only launched their women’s league four years ago, but already they can start to see the fruits of their investment in this game. La Liga Women’s Football Director, Pedro Malabia, has more on how women’s football operates in that space.

The Confederation of Southern African Football Associations (Cosafa) is a leader on the continent when it comes to progress in the women’s football development. Cosafa’s Secretary General has lauded this step taken by SAFA in launching the NWL.
