Willey was due to be the international marquee player for the Paarl Rocks, but he will now be replaced by big-hitting Sri Lankan all-rounder Isuru Udana. South Africans will be familiar with Udana, who was a part of the Sri Lankan squad that took on the Proteas in a five-match ODI series in the build-up to this year's World Cup. Udana's blistering 78 (57) in Port Elizabeth in the 4th ODI of that series when he hit speedster Anrich Nortje to all parts of St. George's Park was memorable. Udana was also Sri Lanka's best player in the T20 series against the Proteas on that tour, with his 84* (48) at Centurion a serious display of power. "He made more than twice the number of runs as any of his colleagues and had a strike rate of more than 170 percent. This is right up with the very best standards by any comparison. 

"He has a career strike rate of 153 in the T20 International format and one of 96 in ODI’s," CSA Acting Director of Cricket, Corrie van Zyl, said in a statement on Friday. He was a regular choice for Sri Lanka throughout the recent ICC Men’s Cricket World Cup which included his playing a crucial role in his country’s upset 20-run win over the eventual champions, England. One of his two wickets was that of England captain Eoin Morgan. "He is currently in action for Sri Lanka in their T20 Series against New Zealand and I am sure the Paarl Rocks players, management and fans will be keeping a close eye on his performances."
