Sudan's UN Ambassador, Omer Mohamed Siddig, told the council on Monday that it is time to shift from peacekeeping to peace building in Darfur, and to end restrictions on the government's movement of arms and troops in and out of the region. In late June, the Security Council voted unanimously to put the brakes on the withdrawal of the joint UN-AU peacekeeping force from Darfur, as the country dealt with a political crisis. It extended the mandate of the force, known as UNAMID, until October 31, and it asked the UN and AU to make recommendations by September 30 on what the council should do about continuing the withdrawal. The UN currently has almost 5 600 so-called blue helmets in Darfur, though plans had been in place to reduce the force's size to 4 050. UN peacekeeping chief Jean-Pierre Lacroix and Chergui both expressed concern about growing tensions between farmers and herders in Darfur, and the AU Commissioner said the current farming season is likely to see more land-related violence. The Darfur conflict took place under the three-decade autocratic rule of former President Omar al-Bashir, during which Sudan was convulsed by a bloody civil war and rebellions, not only in Darfur but in Blue Nile and South Kordofan states. --News24--
