In Kenya, two out of every 10 girls between the ages of 15 and 19 are reported to be pregnant or have a child already. 

The regions with highest prevalence of teen pregnancy in Kenya are Narok County and Kwale (KWAAL-ay) County near the coast. 

In Kwale, parents are now putting their daughters (some as young as 10 years old) on contraception in an attempt to keep them in school.
