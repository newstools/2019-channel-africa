Early on Monday authorities said nine bodies had been retrieved from the crash site and transported to a nearby health centre “for further post-mortem analysis and DNA profiling” Another body was found trapped under the truck, police said. Nine more people injured in the accident later died from their wounds, police spokesperson, Fred Enanga, told Reuters on Monday morning. The accident occurred at a small trading centre on a highway between the capital, Kampala, and Kasese town near the border with Democratic Republic of Congo. Flames from the blast tore through at least 25 shops nearby. Fatal road crashes are frequent in the East African country, often the result of lax law enforcement, poorly serviced vehicles and potholed roads. --Reuters--
