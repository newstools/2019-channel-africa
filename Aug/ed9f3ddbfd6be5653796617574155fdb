The 77 year old leader is grooming his 51 year old son Teodorin and his current vice president to take over the top job of the small oil state in central Africa. Teodoro Obiang came into power in August 3, 1979, he and his officers overthrew his uncle, dictator Francisco Macias Nguema, who was shot two months later. Nguema managed to escape the threats of coup d‘état and worked hard to install omnipotent security services under his direct authority. Since coming to power, he claims to have foiled at least ten coup attempts or assassinations and, at each attempt, Malabo has responded with repression, accusing the army, the opposition or foreign powers alternately. The latest episode to date, Malabo says he foiled an obscure coup attempt in December 2017. The alleged perpetrators, more than 130 people, including many foreigners, were sentenced in June to prison terms ranging from 3 to 96 years. On the other hand, the 1979 coup was described by the authorities as a “Coup de liberté”. It will be celebrated on Saturday in three cities across the country, including Bata, the economic capital, Mongomo, the President’s hometown, and Djibloho, a new city built in the middle of the jungle with petro-dollar money, symbolizing the transformation of this small country, the only Spanish-speaking country on the continent. Nguema, first leader of a country with few resources and treated with sufficiency by other African presidents, benefited from the discovery of oil in territorial waters in the early 1990s. The maps are reworked, the country is getting richer, and is among the highest GDP per capita in Africa: $19 513 per capita in 2017, according to a United Nations report. But this new wealth has mainly been used to finance pharaonic projects, such as Djibloho’s, which alone consumed nearly half of the country’s budget in 2016 to the detriment of education or health. Life expectancy thus stagnates below 60 years in the country. --AfricaNews--
