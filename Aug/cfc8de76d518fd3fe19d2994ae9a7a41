The 21-year-old Belarusian, who was playing in her first final since winning the Shenzhen Open in China in January, was beaten in straight sets by China's Zheng Saisai. But the points she collected from reaching the final means she moves ahead of Serena Williams who drops to number 10. Zheng was the week's biggest mover, climbing 17 places to 38. Roland Garros winner Ashleigh Barty is still number one ahead of Naomi Osaka as the players head to Montreal where a lot of points are at stake. --News24--
