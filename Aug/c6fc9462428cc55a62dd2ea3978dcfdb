The military situation across the landlocked country has been considered stable since the deal, the 13th in a decade, was signed in February between the government and 14 armed groups. But assaults on civilians and fighting among the militias themselves continue unabated in the provinces, and some armed groups are even misusing terms of the pact to tighten their grip. A new report to the United Nations (UN) says impediments to peace range from attacks on civilians and humanitarian workers to "doublespeak" from rebel forces, banditry and arms trafficking. "There is little evidence to demonstrate that there has been a significant change in the behaviour of combatants or that leaders have made efforts to identify and discipline those responsible," according to the report, authored by experts. The panel was founded to advise the UN on enforcing sanctions on the CAR, including travel bans on targeted individuals, the freezing of assets and an arms embargo. The CAR has been struggling to recover from the bloodletting that broke out when former President Francois Bozize, a Christian, was overthrown in 2013 by mainly Muslim Seleka rebels. --TheEastAfrican--
