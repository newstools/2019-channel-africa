An all-race march, women from different creeds, colour and culture coalescing in what would be an iconic moment in history. It was a march against the vicious pass laws.  

These women would lay the foundation for future women. By 1956, the African National Congress Women’s League was 12 years old and it has since bred leaders like Winnie Madikizela Mandela, Albertina Sisulu and Gertrude Shope. Women have traditionally been the bulwark against discrimination and abuse. In 2019, 63 years later, women in South Africa have and are redrawing the political map. But with constant societal changes, the fight for emancipation continues. Women have fought the fight against the apartheid regime. Even 25 years into democracy, the battle has advanced to include other forms of discrimination.
