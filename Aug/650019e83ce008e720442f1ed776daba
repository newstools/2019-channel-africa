KTM Tech3’s Miguel Oliveira emerged from the myWorld Motorrad Grand Prix von Österreich with a personal-best 8th position The eleventh round of MotoGP took place in the fast, scenic and splendid surrounds of the Red Bull Ring in Spielberg but the Grand Prix provided a twist with the weather. Two hot and sunny days of practice and qualification were replaced by much cooler conditions (by ten degrees) and light rain before the Moto3, Moto2 and MotoGP sprints on Sunday. By the time of the premier class outing at 2pm the Austrian asphalt was dry and the race commenced without delay. Brad Binder, who turned 24 on race day, rode to his first Moto2 victory of the season with a strong and defiant performance at the Red Bull Ring. The South African repelled a number of challenges from other riders after making a great start from the front row of the grid and held on for the RC12’s maiden win in 2019 (also his third podium appearance). Team mate Jorge Martin captured his best result of a debut Moto2 year by finishing 7th. Brad Binder: "This is definitely better than buying myself something for my birthday! It was a great race and a great day in front of all the KTM fans and Red Bull here at their home grand prix. It has been a difficult year but for the last few races we have been moving in the right direction and I hope we can finish the season strongly." After back-to-back events MotoGP will break for a week before heading to the United Kingdom for the GoPro British Grand Prix at Silverstone on the last weekend of the month.
