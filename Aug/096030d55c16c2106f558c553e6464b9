Two people have already died from the deadly disease in the city, prompting Rwanda to close its border crossings. They have since reopened the borders but have restricted movement. Health workers in eastern DRC are struggling to contain the year-long Ebola outbreak which has killed more than 1 800-people. The latest infection was announced by the World Health Organisation. Spokesperson, Margaret Harris, says vaccines are now widely accepted but more needs to be done to prevent infected people from going into hiding. Harrisâ€™ statement comes on the back of humanitarian and medical groups in the DRC saying more help is needed to combat the Ebola outbreak. Meanwhile, a local minister said that Rwanda's border with the DRC was fully open late on Thursday, hours after Congolese traders had reported it shut following a third case of the disease in Goma. Rwandan Health Minister, Diane Gashumba, said there had been traffic slowdowns at the border, caused by increased health screening in response to confirmation of new infections. --BBC and Reuters--
