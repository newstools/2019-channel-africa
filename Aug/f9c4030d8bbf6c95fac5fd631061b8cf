The automaker said drivers could remove the key after stopping without placing the car in park, which increases the risk the vehicle could roll away. VW said a build up of silicate on the shift lever micro switch contacts is to blame. Dealers will install and additional switch and circuit board and disable a micro switch.  

A Volkswagen spokesman said there are no reports of injuries.  

The recall covers the Jetta, Beetle, Beetle Convertible, Golf, Golf Sportwagen and GTI from various model years from 2011 through 2019.
