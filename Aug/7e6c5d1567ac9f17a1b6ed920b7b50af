“Now there is peace in Burundi, so refugees have until the October 1 to repatriate. After that we will send them back whether they want to or not,” Kangi Lugola said. The Burundians had fled political unrest in 2015 amid protests over President Pierre Nkurunziza's ultimately successful third-term bid and a subsequent failed coup. A referendum two months later overwhelmingly voted for constitutional reforms that could allow Nkurunziza to stay in office until 2034, although he has said he will not seek re-election next year. The refugees have settled in the Nyarugusu, Nduta and Mtendeli camps in Tanzania’s south-western province of Kigoma. Tanzania is party to the United Nations (UN) refugee convention, which prohibits the forceful return to countries that people have fled from. But Lugola said the UN High Commission  for Refugees (UNHCR) had not respected an agreement made last year between Tanzania and Burundi to repatriate 2000 refugees every week. Last Friday, Lugola and his Burundian counterpart, Pascal Barandagiye visited the Nduta refugee camp warning those that strong measures would be taken if repatriations did not start soon. UNHCR’s Regional Spokesperson, Dana Hughes, called for the two countries to respect international conventions and the rights of refugees. Hughes said the UN refugee agency had been involved in the voluntarily repatriation of Burundi refugees in Tanzania. She added that 100 new refugees were still fleeing from Burundi to Tanzania every month. --BBC--
