An interministerial committee led by Interior Principal Secretary Karanja Kibicho on Monday extended the enumeration time in populous urban centres from 6am to 10pm. It will end at 9pm in the rest of the country. Initially, the headcount was to begin at 6am and end at 6pm countrywide. “Kenyans think it’s taking too long for them to be counted. We have agreed to extend the working hours, especially in the urban areas because they are concentrated, from 6am to 10pm. "This means that enumerators in Nairobi, Mombasa Nakuru, Eldoret, Kisumu Kakamega, Nyeri, Kiambu, Thika, Machakos and Kisii will stop knocking on your doors at 10pm,” Kibicho said. He was accompanied by his counterparts Saitoti Torome (Ministry of Planning), Jerome Ochieng (ICT) and Joe Okuda (Tourism). Kenyans online took the Kenya National Bureau of Statistics (KNBS) to task, accusing the agency of keeping them waiting in their houses in vain. Aware of the concerns, the committee also redeployed 10 000 enumerators who had been assigned special areas like prisons, street families and hotels to back up their colleagues counting people at home to speed up the exercise. --TheEastAfrican--
