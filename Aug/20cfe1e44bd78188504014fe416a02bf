England moved past the Springboks courtesy of their victory over Wales at Twickenham. Wales had the chance to move to No 1 in the rankings above New Zealand - who lost 47-26 to Australia in Perth - but it was not to be as they succumbed to a 33-19 defeat. Even though South Africa picked up just over half a rating point for their victory in Salta, the 1.07 points awarded to England was enough for them to trade places with the Springboks and move up to fourth. Wales stay in second place but are just two-tenths of a point ahead of Ireland, who beat Italy 29-10 in Dublin on Saturday. Despite their big win over the All Blacks, the Wallabies were unable to climb the rankings as the two-and-a-half points gained in victory still leaves them in sixth place behind South Africa.
