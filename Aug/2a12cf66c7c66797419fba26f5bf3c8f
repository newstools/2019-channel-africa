The international rugby sevens players Frank Wanyama, 24, and Alex Olaba, 23, were earlier this month found guilty of the rape in a case which highlighted what some activists refer to as a tradition of "rape culture" in rugby. Milimani High Court Martha Mutuku handed down the sentences of 15 years imprisonment saying "a deterrent sentence is necessary." The trial was held in-camera, so details of the evidence provided were not made public. Mutuku declined a request from the defence lawyers that their clients be allowed to avoid jail time due to their youth and the fact that they had shown remorse. Wanyama and Olaba, who were both university students when the rape took place, play for the Nairobi Harlequins club and have played for the national sevens team, Shujaa, in global tournaments. Through their lawyer Jimmy Simiyu, the two said they regretted the incident and pleaded with the court for a non-custodial sentence. The lawyer noted that Olaba and Wanyama had not planned to meet the musician her at her birthday party that night. They were all drunk, he said, adding the woman opted to spend the night at Seefar Apartments in Highrise, Nairobi, after getting drunk. The lawyer further said the players were from humble backgrounds and that the complainant had tried to extort money from them. Simiyu also noted that the accused dropped out of school to attend court in the case that has gone on for more than one year. --TheEastAfrican--
