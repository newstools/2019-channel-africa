If the World Cup remains the pinnacle of the 50-over game, for England and Australia there's nothing quite like a renewal of Test cricket's oldest rivalry. But now there's arguably more at stake for both sides than the series result. For England, a home season billed as the most important in a generation started brilliantly with their impressive run to a first men's World Cup title that culminated with a Super Over win in a dramatic final against New Zealand at Lord's in July. Building on that groundswell of support is a key part of the England and Wales Cricket Board's post-tournament strategy, while regaining the Ashes represents an ideal chance to keep new fans on board. "It's huge. It's a great opportunity," said England captain Joe Root. "Cricket in this country is probably at an all-time high, it's got interest it probably hasn't had for a long time and we've got an opportunity as a team to make this summer a very memorable one." For Australia, an Ashes series win under the dignified leadership of Tim Paine would help draw a line under the ball-tampering scandal in South Africa that led to long bans for former captain Steve Smith, David Warner and Cameron Bancroft. All three batsmen are likely to feature at Edgbaston, with Bancroft set to hear the same booing that greeted Smith and Warner during the World Cup. Australia have not won an Ashes series in England for 18 years, with their batsmen struggling against the heavily stitched Dukes ball on pitches that offer seam movement.Â "Everyone is excited, it's a huge opportunity to come to England and do something even some of our great teams haven't to do in the last 20 years," said Paine. "We've got some self-belief we can do it." --News24--
