Minister of Public Enterprises Pravin Gordhan is expected to submit the paper to Cabinet. The paper details matters such as the unbundling and breaking down of the power utility. Mthembu told reporters that while the document was not received in Wednesdayâ€™s meeting, the paper would "hopefully" be submitted by the next Cabinet meeting, set to take place in September. "In the next cycle of Cabinet [in two weeks' time], that paper should be there, if I'm not mistaken. The performance of our economy and how we respond to it will be presented by the minister," he said. He added that the consideration of the Eskom paper would be an "integrated Cabinet discussion", taking into account various issues related to Eskom, such as the economy and the spending capacity of the fiscus. "When the Eskom paper comes, and it will, the people who deal with Eskom will present it. But that paper will not be presented on its own. It will come with an analysis of the broader context of what is happening with the economy and the capacity of public finances," said Mthembu. Mthembu noted the latest version of the Integrated Resource Plan was still with the economic cluster of government departments. "The IRP has not come before Cabinet as yet, but it is currently within the system. The revised IRP is before the economic cluster, but it is not before Cabinet as we speak," he said. He added that Cabinet did not discuss the resignations of executives from state-owned enterprises, the latest being that of outgoing South African Post Office CEO Mark Barnes. "When there are resignations at state-owned entities, it does not automatically come to Cabinet. There are nine departments that work with these entities. There was no item on the resignation of a SAPO CEO or an SABC COO. We would more likely register an appointment to an entity," he said. --news24--
