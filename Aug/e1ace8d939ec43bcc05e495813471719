There is an increased chance that Britain will crash out of the EU in October with no trade deal in place under new Prime Minister Boris Johnson, meaning it would default to the World Trade Organization (WTO) tariff system. Chief Executive Warren East, speaking to BBC radio, said Rolls-Royce was well positioned because it already traded under WTO rules. "We would obviously prefer a deal because that is probably the best chance of providing certainty for business, but we've always been prepared for contingency,prepared for a no-deal of some kind," East added. "We're not a 'just-in-time' business like some other businesses, so we are actually in a much stronger position than others. "As far as tariffs and the like are concerned, then most of our business is in aerospace and WTO rules apply anyway." Rolls-Royce has spent $121 million to prepare for Britain's EU exit. On Tuesday, Rolls also reported "good progress" on fixing problems with its troubled Trent 1000 plane engines.
