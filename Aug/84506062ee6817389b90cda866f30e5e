The North African nation are seeking a replacement for Mexican Javier Aguirre, who was sacked after their shock second round exit to South Africa at the Africa Cup of Nations that the country hosted last month. “We will know the name of the national team coach on Wednesday if all goes as normal,” EFA spokesperson, Osama Ismail said. “We are looking at six to seven names to choose one of them. All the candidates are Egyptian.” The media have been floating a number of names around, including former boss Hassan Shehata, who won three Nations Cup titles in a row with The Pharaohs between 2006 and 2010. Others include Hossam El-Badri, ex-national team strikers Hossam Hassan and Mido, and Ihab Galal, who is the coach of Masry.
