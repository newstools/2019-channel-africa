Reports said forces loyal to the warlord Khalifa Haftar launched the attack on Sunday in the town of Murzuq. Al Jazeera learned that the victims were attending a wedding, when the strike hit. Nearly 1 100 people have been reported killed since Haftar, based in eastern Libya, launched an offensive against the capital Tripoli on April 4. On Saturday, Libya's United Nations (UN)-recognised Government of National Accord (GNA) announced said it had downed an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) of Haftar's forces. UN envoy, Ghassan Salame, has proposed a ceasefire for the Muslim holiday of Eid al-Adha, which starts around August 11, and has called for relaunching negotiations. The European Union on Friday also called for Libya's warring sides to establish a permanent truce and return to UN-led talks to prepare for quick elections. On Sunday, France's President Emmanuel Macron spoke with Egyptian leader, Abdel Fattah el-Sisi, about the situation in Libya calling for a ceasefire "very soon" between the warring sides. 'Plan for ceasefire' Macron and Sisi discussed Libya "with the aim of backing the UN's plan for a ceasefire very soon and a renewed dialogue" between Libyan Prime Minister Fayez al-Sarraj and strongman Haftar, Macron's office said. Paris has been seeking to position itself as a mediator in the Libyan crisis, fearing its destabilising effects on the Sahel region of Africa. Egypt, a key backer of Haftar, is concerned about the conflict as it has a long border with Libya. Libya has remained beset by turmoil since 2011, when long-serving leader Muammar Gaddafi was ousted and killed in a bloody NATO-backed uprising.
