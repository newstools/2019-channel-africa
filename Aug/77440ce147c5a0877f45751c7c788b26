The wins also lifted Montsi into the top 100 in the Junior ITF Rankings for the first time. Montsi, who turns 17 in November, says he is very pleased with his performance in Zimbabwe. Montsi is not the first player to make the top 100, and follows in the footsteps of his older brother Sipho, who is currently at college in the USA. The teenager is currently based at the Anthony Harris Tennis Academy in Cape Town, the same academy that brought through Lloyd Harris, who Montsi says is a big inspiration. Interestingly Montsi has already won more junior titles than Harris did. Unlike the big-serving 6 foot 4 Harris, Montsi is a diminutive youngster, and he describes himself as an all-court player.Â
