The London-headquartered lender gave no reason for Flint's sudden departure after just 18 months in the job, but said there was "no personal clash", adding it needed a change at the top. Asia-focused HSBC also revealed it would axe 2% of its global workforce, or roughly 4000 mostly management jobs, in a new restructuring aimed at weathering global turmoil. "HSBC Holdings plc announces that John Flint has today stepped down as Group Chief Executive and as a director by mutual agreement with the board," read a statement. The exact amount Flint will get as a payoff remains unknown until he leaves. Monday's surprise news came shortly before HSBC reported first-half net profit up 18.6% at $8.5 billion from a year earlier. "In the increasingly complex and challenging global environment in which the bank operates, the board believes a change is needed to meet the challenges that we face and to capture the very significant opportunities before us," said Chairperson Mark Tucker. Addressing rumours that Flint was pushed out after a management bust-up, Tucker later told reporters that there had been "no personal clash" and "no disagreement over strategy". Flint, 51, who has spent three decades at HSBC, was keen to lower costs with HSBC facing the double uncertainties caused by the US-China trade war and Brexit. --AFP--
