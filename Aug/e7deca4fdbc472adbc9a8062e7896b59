The largest crypto-currency surged as much as 14% from Friday’s close and traded at $11 749 at 6:14 am in New York, according to consolidated Bloomberg pricing. The Bloomberg Galaxy Crypto Index tracking a basket of crypto-currencies jumped 7.8%, as rival digital coins including Ether and Litecoin also rallied. "With the turmoil in markets and the streets, suddenly digital gold doesn’t seem like such a bad idea,” Jehan Chu, managing partner at block chain investment and advisory firm, Kenetic Capital, said from Hong Kong, where massive public protests continue. “Bitcoin is increasingly seen not only as a bet on the future, but as a shelter for the present." While Bitcoin historically has had relatively low correlation with most asset classes, it has lately moved inversely to Asian stocks. Equities were roiled on Monday after China’s Yuan fell past 7 per Dollar, a key psychological level for traders. The risk-off shift intensified on reports China had asked state buyers to halt imports of American agriculture imports, further escalating trade tensions after US President Donald Trump last week proposed adding 10% tariffs on another $300 billion in Chinese imports starting September 1. "A lot of this might have to do with some capital flight out of China" after Trump’s tariff announcement, said Tom Maxon, head of US operations at electronic-payment products company CoolBitX. He noted that it’s hard to tell for sure, and said the current Bitcoin bull market has produced a lot of positive dynamics that could be feeling the move as well. --News24--
