Addressing parliament, Ncube also said foreign investors can now take majority stakes in the platinum and diamond sectors. The empowerment law adopted in 2008 under Robert Mugabe forced foreign-owned businesses including mines to cede at least 51% shares of their local operations to black Zimbabweans. In a bid to attract investment, President Emmerson Mnangagwa last year removed these requirements for other minerals except diamonds and platinum, which his government said were strategically important. --Reuters--
