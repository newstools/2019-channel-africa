The centres are in Misrata, Tajoura and Khoms. The announcement comes after criticism that migrants were being returned to the Tajoura Detention Centre which had been hit by a missile last month, leading to the death of more than 20 migrants. The centre is also close to the fighting between the United Nations (UN)-recognised government in the capital, Tripoli, and the Benghazi-based Libyan National Army which has vowed to take over the city. Last month, Libyan authorities went on a recovery mission for bodies of migrants who drowned after their boat sunk in the Mediterranean Sea. The UN High Commission for Refugees (UNHCR) at the time said according to some survivors, there were between 250 and 300 migrants and refugees on board the wooden fishing boat. The organisation added that the incident was the deadliest shipwreck in the Mediterranean this year. The UNHCR said it was against returning the survivors to Libya where they are likely to end up in detention camps. --BBC/Reuters--
