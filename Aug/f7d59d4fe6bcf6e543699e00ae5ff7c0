The UAE pledged to construct the pharmaceutical plant yesterday during the official handover of another consignment of equipment and surgical sundries worth about $2 million. The consignment was handed over to the President at Natpharm (Pvt) Ltd. “I am happy that His Highness, the Crown Prince of Abu Dhabi is willing to establish a pharmaceutical plant in Zimbabwe to manufacture the drugs which we need,” said President Mnangagwa. He said Government will accelerate the health sector reform agenda, expand the range of healthcare services and improve affordability and accessibility of pharmaceuticals. Mnangagwa said they are also determined to narrow the gap in quality of services offered in rural and urban areas. “The cost of these drugs to our people should come down. I am happy that besides the UAE, we are also receiving cooperation from India,” he said. Mnangagwa thanked the UAE for the assistance, adding that it will go a long way in improving service delivery in operating theatres, neonatal care, anaesthetics and dialysis. He said the donation from the UAE, follows a request he made during his visit to that country earlier in the year. He explained that the assistance would help the country reach its goal of universal health coverage, which does not leave anyone behind. Critically, the assistance will also help the country in its drive towards the realisation of Government’s vision of providing an efficient, integrated and quality health care system by 2030. --Herald--
