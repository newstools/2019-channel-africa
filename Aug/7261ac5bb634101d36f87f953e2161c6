This comes after both sides emerged victorious on Sunday at the African Hockey Road to 2020 series in Stellenbosch that served as an Olympic qualifier for both men's and women's hockey. The South African women beat Ghana 6-0 in their final group match to finish top of the standings and secure their Olympic qualification, while the men did the same by beating Egypt 3-2 in their final match. Team South Africa did not send sides to the Olympics in Rio last year despite having qualified because SASCOC leadership deemed them not to be a serious medal contender.
