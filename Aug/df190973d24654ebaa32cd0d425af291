About 41 000 civil service workers who failed to show they were alive were struck off between 2015 and 2019, Carmelita Namashulua told a meeting at her ministry in the capital, Maputo. “We were blunt in terms of the proof of life. Whoever failed to turn up in the proof of life would get no salary”. “Me, Carmelita, had to report to the work place to say, 'Here I am alive' in order to enjoy the salary”. The money saved would be used for more services, schools and hospital, she said. --BBC--
