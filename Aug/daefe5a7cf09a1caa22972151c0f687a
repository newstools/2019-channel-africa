The contributions have been deducted from workers' salaries over the last five years, but not been paid to the INSS. Workers risk losing their pensions if the companies do not pay up. Over the weekend Ms Diogo told a social security seminar that some companies deny knowing about the debts and blame their accountants and bookkeepers for not submitting the contributions. The minister said the INSS had recovered $43 million over the last four years from companies that had not submitted workers' contributions, most of it through out-of-court settlements. Only $1.9 million was recovered through the courts. Workers must make a minimum of 200 monthly contributions to qualify for pension that's a period of more than 16 years. If they make contributions over a period of more than 33 years they will receive a pension equivalent to their salary. --BBC--
