Pirates suffered something of a shock 1-0 defeat to the unheralded minnows and now must win by at least two goals later in August. Speaking of what needs to be done to overturn the tie, he told reporters: "We need to prepare ourselves, our chances are absolutely realistic. "We shall do everything possible with performance and not talking, but with the performance on the field of play and we believe that we've got what it takes to get a result that will take us to the second round. "What we have created we didn't convert, and this is where our critical aspect is going. We need to create more to convert more and this is what we are planning to use in our home match. I have belief, confidence and trust in our players. I believe in the work that we will do, and we believe that we will show enough performance that will take us to the second round. "We believed that we dominated in all the aspects of the game except for the crucial aspect and that it is putting the ball in the back of the net. In that regards, I will just say we applied ourselves very well and unfortunately that lapse of concentration at the start of the second half cost us that match. "Is back to (the) drawing (board) for us, we believe that we deserve more from this game than losing. We shall analyse the game, prepare well and in two weeks' time try to score more than two goals to progress to the second round."
