They had been among a group of four diagnosed in Goma, the largest city affected by the outbreak that has so far killed at least 1 800 people. The two others in that group have since died. Scientists however are hopeful that Ebola may soon be a preventable and treatable disease after promising clinical trials of two drugs which, according to expert Dr Sabue Mulangu, saw 60% of the 681 patients survive. With early diagnosis and treatment, however, more than 90% of infected people can survive if they are given REGN-EB3 and mAb114, researchers say. These two drugs were developed using antibodies harvested from survivors of Ebola. Trials were then co-ordinated by the World Health Organisation, and its panel has now recommended the treatments for use by all patients. --BBC--
