With no new players added to the squad following England’s 12-day training camp in Treviso, Italy, Mike Brown (Harlequins), Alex Dombrandt (Harlequins), Ben Spencer (Saracens) and Ben Te’o (unattached) are not included in this week’s squad. In addition, Jack Nowell (Exeter Chiefs) will continue his rehabilitation in camp. Jones told the official RFU website: "We have worked hard and now move into a four-game preparation phase where the development of the team tactically is paramount. We are grateful for the strong opposition to test our game fitness. "By the time we fly out on the 8th of September we will be ready to win the Rugby World Cup. We are not there yet but we have four games to get ready. "Players excluded from being involved in this camp are naturally disappointed but may get another opportunity so they must be ready."

England will play Wales (August 11) and Ireland (August 24) at Twickenham and Italy (September 6) in Newcastle as well as an away fixture against Wales (August 17) in Cardiff.
