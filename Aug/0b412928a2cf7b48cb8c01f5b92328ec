Woods, who signalled his return to form by winning the Tour Championship in Atlanta last year, is currently 27th in the FedEx Cup standings and needs to remain inside the Top 30 by the conclusion of the BMW Championship in order to defend his title at the FedEx Cup finale. The 43-year-old has only played four times since his memorable Masters victory in April, and three of those appearances were in the majors. That has led to question marks over his health and fitness, with Woods reiterating after his recent missed cut at the Open Championship that he plans to dramatically reduce his schedule to prolong his career. "It's just a matter of being consistent," he said. "That's one of the hardest things to accept as an older athlete is that you're not going to be as consistent as you were at 23. "I'm going to have my hot weeks. I'm going to be there in contention with a chance to win, and I will win tournaments. But there are times when I'm just not going to be there. And that wasn't the case 20-odd years ago. I had a different body, and I was able to be a little bit more consistent." Nevertheless, Woods is back on home soil and seems determined to be a factor in the three-week FedEx Cup playoffs.
