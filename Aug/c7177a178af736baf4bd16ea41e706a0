The survey aimed at measuring the favourability of several prominent political figures found that Magashule’s popularity has declined to 11% in July this year, down 5% from the previous month. In a strongly-worded statement, the ANC describes the national survey in which 3 900 people were interviewed face to face since the May elections as a ploy to tarnish leaders that such formations dislike by hiding behind science. It says the research appears to have ulterior motives including the peddling of lies with divisive intentions. Magashule’s favourability rating according to the survey is the lowest amongst top party leaders named, with ANC President Cyril Ramaphosa enjoying the highest favourability rating at 62% in June, down 2% from the previous month. 

Finance Minister, Tito Mboweni, is down 6% in July to 29% and Public Enterprises Minister, Pravin Gordhan, dropping from 31% in June to a low of 26% in July.
