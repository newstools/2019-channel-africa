Liberian lawmakers have in recent years ignored a public outcry over their $12 000 to $15 000 monthly salary. Civil servants get paid $125 a month and more than half the population live below the poverty line, the World Bank says. The new senator, from the Liberty Party, said during his induction that he would not take more than $5 000 a month and promised to put the rest of his monthly earnings into a separate account for the benefit of his constituency. Dillion also declared his assets before taking office, another thing that is unusual in Liberian politics. --BBC--
