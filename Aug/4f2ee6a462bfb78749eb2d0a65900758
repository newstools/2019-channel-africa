The report found evidence of irregularities in the awarding of a security contract. They have been briefing the media in Sandton, north of Johannesburg. The $12 million (R185-million) security tender was given to Mafoko Security Patrols in 2017 despite another company – Mjayeli reportedly scoring higher during the bidding process. The former Interim board says they are shocked by the findings contained in the Special Investigating Unit’s (SIU) report. The board said they were the ones spending sleepless night and making sacrifices to save the South African Broadcasting Corporation (SABC). They also pointed out that they saved the institution half a billion rand while they held the fort between April and September in 2017. The board says the SIU made so many mistakes on a host of issues including basic things such as who reported the matter.
