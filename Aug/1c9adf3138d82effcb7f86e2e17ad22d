The organization, “Generation Identitaire” which is known for being particularly hostile to migrants, had rented two helicopters and a plane during the spring of 2018 to track down migrants trying to make it into France by crossing the Alps. Using patrolling vehicles tagged with the words “Defend Europe”, Generation Identitaire had claimed the handover of four migrants to authorities. The association itself was also fined $83.580.00.
