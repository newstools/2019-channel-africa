During a visit to Berlin for talks with Chancellor Angela Merkel, Greece's new conservative Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis said that his country was running large primary surpluses, which exclude debt servicing.

"But I have also said that Greece will maintain its financial aims for 2019 and 2020," he told journalists.

"What we need to do first is to win political credibility as a reform government, and to place growth as the priority.

"And then, there are questions that will be discussed with the creditors and possibly on the bilateral level."

Greece's out-of-control spending had triggered a major eurozone crisis a decade ago, and nearly led to the demise of the single currency bloc.

Since then, Athens has carried out painful reforms in exchange for three bailouts worth $330 billion from the European Union, the European Central Bank and the International Monetary Fund.

The country exited its third and final international bailout in August 2018.

Nevertheless, its debt load remains high with public debt standing at $372 billion or 180% of GDP in 2018.

The debt load is forecast to fall to 168% of GDP this year, but only through the belt-tightening brought in by the previous leftist government which Mitsotakis's New Democracy party says is stifling growth.  

While in Berlin, Mitsotakis urged German companies to invest in Greece and help the country in its reform path.
