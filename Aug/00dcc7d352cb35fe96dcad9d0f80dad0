As the new week kicks off, stocks are in demand amid increased optimism over US and China reaching a trade deal and as investors anticipate stimulus measures to shore up slowing economies, noted Fiona Cincotta, analyst at City Index trading group. "After a disastrous previous week which saw equities experience the worst week this year, risk appetite was showing strong signs of improving." Washington and Beijing are working to revive pivotal talks aimed at ending the trade war that has roiled world markets, Trump's chief economic advisor Larry Kudlow said Sunday. The US president himself weighed in on Twitter, saying, "We are doing very well with China, and talking!" In another tweet, he added that the US economy was "poised for big growth after trade deals are completed," and that China is "eating Tariffs."

The German economy could meanwhile enter a recession in the third quarter because of a "sharp" decline in industrial production held back by international trade tensions, the Bundesbank warned Monday. --AFP--
