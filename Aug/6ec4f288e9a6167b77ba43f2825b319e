The bill creating an NHI Fund paves the way for a comprehensive overhaul of South Africa’s health system that would be one of the biggest policy changes since the ruling African National Congress ended white minority rule in 1994. The existing health system in Africa’s most industrialized economy reflects broader racial and social inequalities that persist more than two decades after apartheid ended. Less than 20 percent of South Africa’s population of 58 million can afford private healthcare, while a majority of poor blacks queue at understaffed state hospitals short of equipment. Anban Pillay, deputy director general at the health department, told reporters an initial Treasury estimate of 206 billion rand costs by 2022 was more likely to be 256 billion rand by the time final numbers had been reviewed. The bill proposes that the NHI Fund, with a board and chief executive officer, also be funded from additional taxes. "The day we have all been waiting for has arrived: today the National Health Insurance Bill is being introduced in parliament," said Health Minister Zweli Mkhize at the briefing, adding that the pooling of existing public funds should help reduce costs.
