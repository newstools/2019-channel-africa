Pinga, the village where the case was reported, lies about 150 kilometres northwest of Goma, one of the towns affected by the Ebola epidemic, and much further away from the epicenter of the epidemic in Butembo and Beni. The ministry data also showed a third case confirmed in South Kivu region, which on Friday reported its first cases, more than 700 kilometres south of where the first case was detected. The widening geographic spread of the virus, and its presence in yet another zone under the sway of armed groups, raises the risk of it spreading out of control, even while the technical tools to rein it in are better than ever. Walikale is controlled almost entirely by a Mai Mai ethnic militia, surrounded by forest and difficult to access because of poor roads. Ebola has killed at least 1 900 people in Congo over the past year, the second biggest toll in the diseaseâ€™s history, after a 2014-16 outbreak in West Africa that killed 11 300 people.

Unlike during that outbreak, there are now major medical advances that have helped fight the disease, including two trial vaccines, both of which are being deployed, mobile treatment units and experimental treatments that show the promise of a 90% survival rate.
