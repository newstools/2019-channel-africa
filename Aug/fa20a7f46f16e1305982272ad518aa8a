Stuart Baxter shocked the South African public by stepping down to end his second spell as head coach on Friday, August 2. "Someone should continue with this project and therefore I am resigning as Bafana Bafana head coach. It was my personal decision to step down," Baxter told reporters at a press conference in Johannesburg. He was appointed on May 4, 2017, on a five-year contract following the ousting of then-coach Shakes Mashaba. SAFA's intention of having a long-term coach to see out their famous '2022 Vision' has now fallen apart at the halfway mark. Following Baxter's resignation, SAFA were quick to announce Molefi Ntseki as the national team's interim coach. SAFA have appointed seven coaches in the last 10 years and a total of 26 since readmission in 1992. Mashaba, Jomo Sono, Trott Moloto, Stuart Baxter, Carlos Alberto Parreira and Pitso Mosimane have all had more than one stint as head coach - either on a caretaker duty or being appointed on a permanent basis. --News24--
