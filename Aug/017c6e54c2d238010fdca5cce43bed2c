Sredojevic resigned as head coach of Orlando Pirates on Friday to take up the reins at Zamalek, where he has signed a one-year contract. Micho left South Africa under a cloud of controversy, having been accused by a hotel cleaner of indecent exposure, as reported in the Sunday World. The Serb tactician said he was jetting out of the country to attend to his gravely ill mother, but soon afterwards joined Zamalek, leaving many to become suspicious. "Micho signed a one-season contract for $1.2 million (R18 million). The contract includes a release clause stipulating a compensation worth two months of the coach’s salary‚" Mansour revealed. After his appointment, Sredojevic admitted that it was an offer too good to refuse. "I’m very delighted to lead Zamalek. I have worked in coaching on the African continent since 2001. I always try to perform well and achieve positive results where I work‚" he said. "I will be assisted by two Serbian coaches‚ one of them is for the goalkeepers. "I will offer my best performance to Zamalek‚ and the players’ high quality will help me. With spirit‚ determination and commitment I can achieve everything. "I would like to thank Orlando Pirates‚ but coaching Zamalek is a dream for anyone."
