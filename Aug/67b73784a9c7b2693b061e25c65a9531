Soldiers and armed police on horseback and in trucks patrolled the central business district and most of the high density suburbs.

Using loudhailers, police warned people against joining the demonstration, which was called to protest at deteriorating economic conditions. 

One of the city's usually busy areas, the precincts of Tredgold Magistrate Courts, where illegal forex changers ply their trade, was cordoned off. 

Police also set up checkpoints on most roads leading to the city centre.

The authorities banned the protests, organised by the opposition Movement for Democratic Change (MDC), after police routed protesters who had defied a similar order in Harare on Friday. 

"The move by the government to ban the demonstration shows they are running scared," Mbuso Fuzwayo, of the rights pressure group Ibhetshu Likazulu, told AFP as military helicopters hovered over the city, an opposition stronghold.

"They don't have confidence in themselves. This is like Rhodesia. This is primitive," he said referring to the British colonial rule era. 

The MDC is challenging the ban in court, which is expected to issue a ruling at 1400 GMT. 

The protesters are angry over the country's floundering economy and the jailing of a well-known government critic, tribal chief Felix Ndiweni.
