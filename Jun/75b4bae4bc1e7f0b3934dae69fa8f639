While there are no signs that international sanctions imposed on North Korea over its nuclear weapons will be officially lifted soon, researchers at a United States (US)-based think tank say North Korea has more fundamental problems to overcome if it wants access to foreign finance. "Although an easing of sanctions imposed on the North because of its nuclear weapons program is necessary, it is not sufficient for the North to gain full access to the global capital market," said a yet-to-be published report by The Korea Society seen by Reuters. "Concentric layers of US and international financial prohibitions, including concerns over money laundering and the integrity of North Koreaâ€™s regulatory system, would have to be peeled away," the report said. US President, Donald Trump, has held out massive economic stimulus as an incentive for North Korea to give up its nuclear weapons.
