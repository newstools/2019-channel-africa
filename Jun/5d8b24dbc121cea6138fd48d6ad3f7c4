The men, arrested on Monday, are accused of attempting to recruit and enrol people in their "terrorist plan" and were "in the process of preparing terrorist attacks in the kingdom", AFP quotes the police as saying. The news comes as a suspected leader of a johadist cell told a Moroccan court on Friday that he beheaded one of the two women found murdered in the High Atlas Mountains in December. He is on trial along with 23 other alleged Islamists. --BBC--
