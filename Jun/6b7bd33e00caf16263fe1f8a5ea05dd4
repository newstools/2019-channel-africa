Tran Cong Khai was accused of working with the Provisional National Government of Vietnam (PNGV), a California-based organisation with a self-appointed prime minister that pledges allegiance to the former South Vietnam regime. A Ho Chi Minh City court found him guilty of calling people to join a referendum to usher PNGV's leader Dao Minh Quan into power, with the intention of bringing him back to Vietnam to rule, the official Vietnam News Agency (VNA) reported. He was also accused of planning an attack at a 2017 meeting of world leaders from the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC), which included US President Donald Trump, Russia's Vladimir Putin and Xi Jinping of China. Khai was arrested before the alleged attack could take place, VNA said. The court said Khai's actions were "very serious and dangerous for society", VNA reported, adding that Khai "admitted his crimes" at the half-day trial. He was given eight years for attempting to overthrow the government, a charge that carries a maximum sentence of death. The trial comes just days after US citizen Michael Nguyen was jailed for 12 years on the same charges alongside two activists. The father of four was arrested in July last year during a trip to Vietnam from his hometown in California. --AFP--
