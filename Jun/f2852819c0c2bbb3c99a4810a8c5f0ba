The Egyptian tugboat Maridive 601 had rescued the migrants off the southern Tunisian coast in late May after they embarked from Libya, a key launchpad for sub-Saharan Africans making dangerous bids to reach Europe by sea. A Red Crescent team based in the southern Tunisian city of Zarzis delivered aid and medical care to the migrants, some of whom were ill, said Mongi Slim, a Red Crescent official. The captain of the vessel refused to comment to AFP. But six days earlier he had appealed to Tunisian authorities for urgent permission to access Zarzis port - permission they have not so far given.
"The migrants want to be welcomed by a European country," said an interior ministry official on condition of anonymity.
