Down on the ground floor, his fighters detained rattled employees, confiscating their cell phones and refusing to tell them what was happening, eyewitnesses told AFP on Friday. "They said, 'donâ€™t move, stay where you are,'" recalled guesthouse manager Moges Ayalew, who at first believed the gunmen were ordinary soldiers. In addition to opening fire at the regional president's office, killing him and at least two other officials, Asaminew's supporters tried to storm the police headquarters and a regional media house during the violence that began last Saturday afternoon, residents of Bahir Dar said. Several hours later, Ethiopia's army chief and a retired general were shot dead in a separate attack in the capital Addis Ababa that authorities say was linked to the "coup" plot. All the while, Asaminew himself said nothing, according to those at the guesthouse, who claim they were oblivious to the chaos unfolding outside the property. A police officer stationed at the guesthouse, which refused to give his name for safety reasons, said Asaminew's fighters wore uniforms he had never seen before and that they pointed their weapons at a security guard but didn't shoot anyone. Finally at around 10pm, Asaminew and half dozen fighters drove off in three vehicles, the eyewitnesses said. Two nights later, officials announced that Asaminew -- who had been serving as the regional security chief, had been shot dead by security forces outside Bahir Dar, the Amhara regional capital. --AFP--
