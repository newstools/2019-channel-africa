But the general medium-term prognosis for the Proteas is just as worrying, as things stand. The rising likelihood of a significantly failed CWC campaign will be followed by the threat of very little respite from their angst, right now you would not stake your house on them even holding their own in the Test tour of India from mid-September.

Considering that a good number of their one-day international personnel should also be part of the major Subcontinent challenge, the three five-day clashes there will form part of the ICC’s new World Test Championship a defiant finish to their World Cup, even if much of it may well be after the horse has bolted, will be vital to mustering a semblance of regenerated confidence for the India trek. That is scheduled to be the Proteas’ first activity following CWC 2019, and there is a case for arguing that Cricket South Africa could do worse than hastily assemble some sort of spring mini-series against a weaker foe - like neighbours Zimbabwe? - to help the process of the players getting their groove back, as it were, if it is deemed necessary in the aftermath of the World Cup. Then again, a period of head-clearing and down time from the exhausting cricketing treadmill might instead be of better value for several of South Africa’s all-formats playing assets, as “off-seasons” are less and less generous (or even sometimes virtually non-existent) these days. --News24--
