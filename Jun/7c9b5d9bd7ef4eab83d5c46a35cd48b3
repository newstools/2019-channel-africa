The Proteas are yet to register a win at the tournament, losing their first three fixtures before Monday's 'no-result' against the West Indies got them their first log point. There have been glimpses of positivity with both bat and ball, but the South Africans have not been near stringing together a complete performance yet. It has severely hurt their chances of progressing to the semi-finals, and they must now surely win their remaining matches to do so. All of the top order batsmen in the South African side, with the exception of Hashim Amla, have made starts at different times but none have stood up to play the type of match-winning innings that they need. There have been just three half-centuries from the Proteas so far, with Quinton de Kock's 68 against England in the tournament opener still their best individual return with the bat.
