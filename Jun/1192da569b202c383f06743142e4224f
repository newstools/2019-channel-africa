According to a second crop and livestock assessment report released by the Ministry of Agriculture, the estimated maize production stands at 776 635 tons, which is 54% less than the 1 700 702 tonsÂ obtained during the 2017/2018 season. In addition to false season starts in some parts of the country, long dry spells in January and February also negatively affected the planted crop. "Cereal production is 851 844 tons against a national cereal requirement of 1 754 225 tons for human consumption," reads the report. The poor harvest will leave most families without adequate food supplies. The country requires at least 1.8 million tons of maize per season. Out of the 60 administrative rural districts in the country, 18% have enough cereal to last until the next harvest and the rest (49 districts) will last between 2 and 11 months. Meanwhile, the country is also expecting a 26% drop in tobacco output to 185 725 tons, while cotton is expected to drop by 49% to 66.564 tons. --News24--
