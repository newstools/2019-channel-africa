Skipper Faf du Plessis leads a side with two changes after South Africa's second straight defeat on Sunday. Top-order batsman, Hashim Amla, returns to the XI after missing the previous match against Bangladesh and, with paceman Lungi Ngidi injured, the Proteas are playing two spinners. "Mostly because of the make-up of the side playing two spinners, that's the most attacking option," Du Plessis said at the toss. "We didn't have the ideal start, but we need to keep going. We need to win six games to get to the semis, we have seven games left, so definitely not over yet." South Africa announced on Tuesday that pace spearhead Dale Steyn had been ruled out of the World Cup without playing a match - a major blow. Tournament favourites India are also playing two wrist spinners in Kuldeep Yadav and Yuzvendra Chahal, with paceman Mohammed Shami missing out. India skipper Virat Kohli said that good backing in Southampton would lift his team. "The crowd support will be massive for us. Lots of people who live here and lots who are travelling here," said Kohli. "For us it's about keeping composure, remembering why we got the results in the last two years and continuing the same way," he added.
