Culzean will account for around 5% of the UK's gas consumption, bringing to 18% the proportion of the country's gas demand supplied by Total. Total has a 49.99% stake in Culzean, while BP has 32%and JX Nippon has 18%. "The Culzean project is delivered ahead of schedule and more than 10% below the initial budget, which represents cape savings of more than $500 million. This has been achieved thanks to the excellent performance of the project teams in charge of the construction and drilling operations," said Arnaud Breuillac, President of Exploration & Production at Total. --reuters--
