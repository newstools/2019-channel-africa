In an interview, Public Service, Labour and Social Welfare Minister Dr Sekai Nzenza said President Mnangagwa was concerned about the livelihoods of civil servants hence Government’s intervention. Salaries of most workers in the country have been eroded by wanton increases in the prices of goods and services. Nzenza said the Minister of Finance and Economic Development, Professor Mthuli Ncube, will announce a civil servants salary hike in the coming days. At this stage the Minister of Finance is looking at salary increase. He would be making an announcement in the next few days. I can’t give you the exact date because he has to do the figures. But he would be looking at that in light of the current situation. We know it’s not easy; this is why we are looking at the cost of living adjustment,” said Minister Nzenza. “You’ll remember that from January to March we gave them cushioning allowance and then there was the cost of living adjustment. But we realised that the economy is not doing good and people are hurting because of prices and we have now once again been talking to the Minister of Finance and he is seriously looking at it and at the same time the President is very concerned.” Government in April announced a $400 million cost of living adjustment package for civil servants which saw the lowest-paid employee taking home over. This was part of Government’s move to cushion its workers from the obtaining economic challenges. --Herald--
