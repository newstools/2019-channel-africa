Nigeria became the first side to book their round of 16 spot following victory over Guinea. Much like in their opening match against Burundi, the Super Eagles had to toil for a result against Guinea. The win took the Super Eagles to six points from two games. It’s a comfortable lead in Group B ahead of their final group game against Madagascar on Sunday also in Alexandria. Chelsea defender Kenneth Omeruo expressed his excitement after seeing his country progress to the next round. He netted the vital winning goal in the 73rd minute of the match. “The coaches have provided us with enough material; we have been watching them and we knew that they are the toughest opponents we would meet in the group and I’m so happy that we qualified after this game.” Egypt’s second match against the DRC saw the Pharaohs score two first half goals for victory. 25 minutes into the game, Ahmed Elmohamady broke the deadlock. Having created the opener, star player Mohamed Salah added the second two minutes before the break, with a sublime finish. --Lebohang Dube--
