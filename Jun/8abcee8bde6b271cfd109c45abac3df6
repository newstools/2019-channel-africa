The Paris-based Sudan reports says Abiy will meet the two parties to try to persuade them to accept a draft agreement put together in the Ethiopian capital, Addis Ababa, on a political transition. Abiy was in Khartoum on 7 June where he held separate meetings with opposition and the TMC leaders. His special envoy, Mahmoud Dirir, said the TMC and the FFC had agreed to resume talks on the formation of the Sovereign Council, the institution that is supposed to run the country for three years. An opposition member said Ethiopia proposed that the sovereign council be comprised of eight civilians and seven military officers with a rotating presidency. The head of the TMC, Lt Gen Abdel Fattah al-Burhan, said on Wednesday that he was ready to resume negotiations with the opposition on the country’s transition to democracy. Talks between the two sides collapsed after the security forces violently dispersed a protest sit-in in Khartoum on 3 June. The state-run Suna news agency quoted Lt Gen Burhan saying the TMC was read to “complete the dialogue”. --BBC--
