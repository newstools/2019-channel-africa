This comes after they were knocked out of the tournament following a 4-0 defeat to Germany in the final Group B match on Monday. Banyana Banyana failed to win a match in France as Spain and China beat the South Africans respectively. "Thank you for all the support throughout this journey," Van Wyk said. "I'm sure team Banyana Banyana has caught the eye of many people around the world with the way we displayed our football, our spirit and character! "Many rule us out before we even started. Sometimes its not about winning to be seen or spoken about. sometimes its about showing your worth and what value you bring to the game with the "NEVER SAY DIE" kind of attitude." South Africa will fly out of France on Tuesday night (18 June) and are expected to land on Wednesday morning (19 June) at 10:45.
