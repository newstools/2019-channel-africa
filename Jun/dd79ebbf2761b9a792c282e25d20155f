Mele Kolo Kyari, a geologist who held the position of group general manager of NNPC's crude oil division, replaces Maikanti Kacalla Baru who was appointed in July 2016. Kyari was appointed alongside seven chief operating officers. No reason was given for the shake-up. Nigeria is Africa's biggest oil producer and, according to news agency Bloomberg, pumps up more than two million barrels a day. --BBC--
