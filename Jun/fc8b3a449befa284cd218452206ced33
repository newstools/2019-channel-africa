Oil-rich Venezuela is locked in a political and economic crisis. Opposition leader Juan Guaido invoked Venezuelaâ€™s constitution in January to assume the interim presidency, saying President Nicolas Maduro's reelection was not legitimate. Most Western countries have since backed Guaido as head of state but Maduro retains the support of China and Russia. Xi told TASS news agency and Rossiyskaya Gazeta newspaper that China opposes foreign interference, unilateral sanctions, the use of force, or threats of the use of force, when it came to Venezuela. "China is willing to work with the international community to play a positive and constructive role on the Venezuela issue," Xi said, according to a transcript published by China's Foreign Ministry ahead of his arrival in Russia on Wednesday. China was also willing to "help Venezuela return to a normal development path as soon as possible", he said.
