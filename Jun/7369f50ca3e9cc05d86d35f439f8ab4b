Most of those who were denied licences are local co-operatives that have been at the heart of some fatal mining accidents, as well as some foreign investors whose capital was deemed lower than what is required, officials at the Mining Board said. Mining accidents had killed at least 50 people and injured 40 by May this year. The Cabinet approved applications from only six companies. The companies were offered 13 mining and quarrying contracts valued at over $25 million. Local companies Africeramic and Mountain Ceramics were granted licences to exploit clay deposits in the country. The others are Polish company Luna Smelter, which was granted eight exploration licences for cassiterite and coltan in Gatsibo District for four years. The company is expected to invest at least $14.4 million in the business. Luna Smelter runs the only tin smelter in the country, in partnership with Ngali Holdings, a locally-registered parastatal. A Chinese investment, Paragon Mining Industry, was awarded a medium scale mining license for cassiterite and coltan for five years, with a total initial investment plan of $5.2 million. The stringent licensing procedure comes after a new mining law last year effectively blocked investment proposals valued below $8 million. The mining sector has over the past decade fetched Rwanda the second-highest revenues after tourism. But currently, its principle minerals, cassiterite, wolfram and coltan, have been hit by low prices on the international market, adversely affecting the lives of hundreds of thousands of artisanal miners and the revenue that the country generates from the sector. Rwanda's earnings from minerals doubled to $373 in 2017 from $166 million in 2016, according to the Mining Board. But last year, earnings dropped by more than $20 million to $347.6 million mainly as a result of poor performance in the last quarter. --TheEastAfrican--
