The panel looking into of the Special Anti-Robbery Squad (Sars) investigated allegations of widespread human rights violations. Sars is in charge of combating armed robbery and kidnappings across the country but has been accused of extra-judicial killings, arbitrary arrests, torture and extortion. President Muhammadu Buhari asked the panel to make recommendations on how to hold police officers accountable. In addition to the prosecutions, the panel recommended that the police pay compensation to 45 of those who have complained. President Buhari said the recommendations will be implemented within three months and said police officers should be held accountable for their actions. In 2017, the #EndSars campaign began on Twitter as people complained about police brutality. The campaign began when footage was shared allegedly showing the aftermath of the police killing of a young man. Many Nigerians responded with their own accounts of their ordeals at the hands of officers from Sars. --BBC--
