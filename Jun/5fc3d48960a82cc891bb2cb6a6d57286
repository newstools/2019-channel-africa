Hundreds of soldiers and officers in uniform gathered for a ceremony in a huge hall in central Addis Ababa. Roads in the capital were blocked for the ceremony and security was tight. Access to the internet appeared to be blocked across Ethiopia for the third straight day, users reported. The coffins of army chief of staff Seare Mekonnen and a retired general, both shot dead on Saturday by Seare’s bodyguard in the national capital Adis Abeba, were wheeled into the hall, draped in Ethiopian flags. Photographs of the men in formal military dress were adorned with yellow roses. Seare will be buried in his home region of Amhara on Wednesday. The violence underscores the tenuous grip of the federal government on spiralling ethnic violence in Africa’s second-most populous nation. Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed walked into the hall, sat down, and bowed his head, appearing grief-stricken, while other dignitaries and officials from the country’s Orthodox church arrived. --Reuters--
