Warner's international career came to a juddering halt when he was given a 12-month ban for his part in a ball-tampering scandal during a Test against South Africa in Cape Town last year. At that stage, there was widespread speculation that Warner, widely regarded as the instigator of an event that saw Cameron Bancroft apply sandpaper to the ball, might never play for Australia again. But having completed a year-long ban, the 32-year-old Warner has been in superb form for the reigning champions at the World Cup. The left-handed opener made Bangladesh pay for dropping him on 10 at Trent Bridge on Thursday by scoring 166, his second century of the World Cup, in a total of 381-5. That proved too much for the Tigers to chase, with Australia winning by 48 runs to go top of the 10-team round-robin table. Bangladesh's total was still their largest in an ODI while the 714 runs shared between the two teams was a World Cup record, surpassing the 688 scored by Australia and Sri Lanka in 2015. Warner is now this World Cup's leading run-scorer with 447 runs at an average of 89.4. Having acknowledged it had been a "dark year for Australian cricket", Warner was asked if there had been any personal benefits to his enforced break. --News24--
