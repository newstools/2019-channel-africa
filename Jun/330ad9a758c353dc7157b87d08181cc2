Nadal is coming into the tournament on the back of his 12th French Open crown, but has never seemed to impress Kyrgios much on a personal level. Now, Kyrgios may have perpetuated their growing disdain for each other by tipping Novak Djokovic and Roger Federer to dominate at SW19 again. "Over five sets I don't think anyone will ever beat Rafa at the French Open," Kyrgios said. "It's just too hard physically. But at Wimbledon it's going to be tough to beat Novak or Federer." Kyrgios is already in Nadal's bad books after he described him as a bad loser following their clash in Acapulco, which the Australian won, earlier this year. In the same interview, he also branded world No 1 Novak Djokovic "cringeworthy" for his apparent desperation to be loved by the crowd. He, though, doesn't think those comments will make Nadal or Djokovic any more motivated to beat him when they next meet on court. "I have played Rafa a bunch of times. We have beaten each other, as well. "I don't think before those comments they were, like, 'Oh, I don't really care.' They wanted to beat me, regardless. But my opinions won't change. I don't mind. When we go out there and we battle, that's what it is."
