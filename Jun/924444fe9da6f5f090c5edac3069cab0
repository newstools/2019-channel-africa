The country has been on high alert since the attacks at the weekend in the capital Addis Ababa and northern Amhara state left the national army chief, a retired general and three senior regional officials dead. The violence has underscored the pressure on Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed who has pursued democratic and economic reforms that critics say have left the country divided and wracked by ethnic fighting. A taskforce commissioned to probe what the government has called an attempted coup by a renegade security chief said the attackers conspired to kill a "wide array of government officials". The Security and Justice Taskforce "has arrested 212 suspects in Amhara region and 43 suspects in Addis Ababa," it said in a statement issued late Thursday. "Destructive forces have ignored the government's mercy and kindness to commit an act of treason," it added. Two heavy machine guns and 27 automatic rifles were also seized during the arrest. An ethno-nationalist party in Amhara had said earlier Thursday that more than 56 of its members and supporters had been arrested in Addis Ababa alone. It is unclear if these were among the 255 arrests mentioned by the taskforce. The government has accused Amhara security Chief Asaminew Tsige of orchestrating the two attacks at the weekend. On Saturday in Bahir Dar, the state capital, gunmen entered a meeting of top Amhara officials and opened fire, killing the regional president, his top adviser and the attorney general. A few hours later in Addis Ababa, some 500 kilometres away, army chief Seare Mekonnen was shot dead by his bodyguard. A retired general visiting him was also killed. --AFP--
