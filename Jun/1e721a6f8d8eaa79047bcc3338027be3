The match, which is being used by South Africa as a part of their preparations for the upcoming 2019 Africa Cup of Nations tournament in Egypt, was moved to a later kick-off due to the scorching heat in the United Arab Emirates. Temperatures in Dubai can go beyond 40 degree Celsius meaning it would make it unsafe for players to compete closer to the middle of the afternoon. Bafana assistant coach Molefi Ntseki reportedly met with members of the Ghanaian delegation to organise for the friendly match to be moved to a later time. In the encounter, both sides have agreed that they can use as many players as they want meaning multiple substitutions can take place. Stuart Baxter's men will hope for a positive result as they look ahead to facing their Group D opponents Morocco, Namibia and Ivory Coast in the AFCON later this month.
