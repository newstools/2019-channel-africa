The vote had been billed as an historic first for the conservative Saharan desert nation, marking the first democratic transition in its coup-strewn history. "We are going to organise protest demonstrations, it's our constitutional right," Mohamed Ould Moloud who joined three other losing candidates, told a press conference late Sunday. Supporters are being asked to join the four on Monday afternoon as they march to the country's election board, CENI, in the capital Nouakchott. There, they will "register their protest and rejection of the results," said another candidate, journalist Baba Hamidou Kane. The ruling party's candidate, Mohamed Ould Ghazouani, won the presidency outright with 52% of the vote, the electoral commission announced Sunday. Ghazouani easily beat main opposition opponents Biram Ould Dah Ould Abeid, an anti-slavery activist credited with 18.58% of the vote, followed by Sidi Mohamed Ould Boubacar, with 17.87%, according to the official figures from Saturday's polls. But opposition parties said flaws in the vote had strengthened their fears of a power grab by the military. Abdel Aziz, a general, came to power in a coup in 2008, and Ghazouani was his chief of staff for a decade. "Multiple irregularities have eliminated any credibility" in the elections, said Boubacar, a former prime minister. --AFP--
