Lee and Ancer joined Ryan Armour, Bronson Burgoon, Zach Sucher and Canada's Mackenzie Hughes in the lead after carding six-under-par 64s in benign conditions at the TPC River Highlands course in Cromwell, Connecticut. Ancer forced his way into the leadership picture with a superb performance down the stretch, making five birdies on the back nine after reaching the turn at one under for the day. Armour, Burgoon, Sucher and Hughes meanwhile all ensured their places at the top of the leaderboard after draining birdies on their final holes. Of the leading pack, none was more pleased than Burgoon, who has endured a nightmare 2019 which has seen him miss the cut in 10 of his 14 starts. The most recent of those came at Memorial, where he failed to make the weekend after reaching the halfway stage at three over. "Right after Memorial I was in a pretty dark place when it came to my golf game," said Burgoon. "I took two weeks off and regrouped and refocused and got a lot of really good work in," added the 32-year-old Texan, who is still looking for his first PGA Tour title. --News24--
