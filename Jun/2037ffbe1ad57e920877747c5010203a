After four years at which course conditions or rules controversies made headlines at their signature event, USGA senior managing director of championships John Bodenhamer acknowledged Wednesday that it was "critical" the US Open spotlight return to the players and their skills. "We've talked about it all year long," Bodenhamer said. "We all feel a great obligation in that regard, not just to the championship but also to serve the mission of the USGA. "But, again, I will say: We feel good about our plan. We feel good about what you see on the golf course and what we're going to present to the players as a tough but true test." Top players uniformly say they welcome the challenge of narrow fairways, punishing rough and treacherous greens that traditionally make the US Open a test of mental and physical stamina as well as skill. But the build-up to the 119 US Open at cherished Pebble Beach Golf Links has included rumbles of discontent over recent miscues stretching back to the shocking condition of the greens at Chambers Bay in 2015 and including the 2016 rules debacle at Oakmont, which saw eventual winner Dustin Johnson play the last seven holes without being certain of his score. In 2017 the wide fairways of Erin Hills were derided as more fitting to a regular tour event. --News24--
