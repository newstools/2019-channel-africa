Ndabeni-Abrahamsâ€™ comment follows recent media reports that suggest that the SABC might not be able to pay its employees come month-end. Speaking outside Parliament, before the sitting of the State of the Nation Address (SONA) on Thursday, Ndabeni-Abrahams say processes are under way to ensure that the SABC gets the much-needed bailout. "Rest assured, as soon as the Treasury finalises their processes, the SABC will continue with what it is doing. You are not going to get any blackout that we promise." --SABC--
