There has been speculation regarding the France international's future at the Parc des Princes over the last few months, with links to Real Madrid refusing to go away. Mbappe still has four years to run on the contract he signed last summer after joining on a permanent basis from Monaco and the club's president, Al-Khelaifi, has now vehemently insisted the 20-year-old will be going nowhere over the next few months. "Mbappe will be 200% at PSG next season," Al-Khelaifi told AS. Reports continue to link Neymar with a move away from PSG and there certainly appears to be some discontent behind the scenes in Paris following the club's poor end to last season. Al-Khelaifi believes a change in attitude is needed heading into the new campaign and has called for his players to step up to the plate. "Players must assume their responsibilities, even more than before, it must be completely different, they will have to do more, work more," Al-Khelaifi added. "They're not here to please themselves, and if they do not agree, the doors are open, Ciao, I do not want star behaviour anymore."
