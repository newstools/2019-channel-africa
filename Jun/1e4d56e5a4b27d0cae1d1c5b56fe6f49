Kenyans have the bragging rights after beating their neighbours 3-2 and Tanzania cannot now qualify for the knock-out stages. A Kenyan Twitter account has posted a video of a distressed Tanzanian fan who's saying: "It's not fair, it's the fans who are feeling the pain not the players on the pitch." Speaking after the match Tanzanian captain, Mbwana Samatta, apologised to the fans. "It's the kind of game that pains us a lot, but it's just a game. We have disappointed our fans, we can't change anything," he told BBC Swahili. His opposite number, Victor Wanyama, was celebrating. "I know that when we settled down with the ball, we would beat Tanzania. Tanzania is not a bad team but I knew they wouldn't take long before they started to panic," he said. One Kenyan fan in the coastal city of Mombasa told the BBC that Tanzania may be able to beat Kenya "with words, but they can't beat us with actions. Tanzania will always be behind us." --BBC--
