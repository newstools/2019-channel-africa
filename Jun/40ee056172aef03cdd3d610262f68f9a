Samoura, 56, will take charge for six months from 1 August, with the relationship "renewable" should Fifa and the Confederation of African Football (Caf) both agree. A Senegal native and former United Nations official, she will remain as secretary general but some of her tasks will be delegated to other other Fifa members. Caf has recently been in the spotlight following allegations of corruption against Admad Ahmad, the organisation's president. Ahmad has denied any wrongdoing. In a statement, Fifa said Caf would undergo a forensic financial audit "as soon as possible". --BBC--
