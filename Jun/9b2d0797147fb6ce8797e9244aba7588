The challenge of investing in electric, hybrid and autonomous vehicles while having to overhaul combustion engines to meet new clean-air rules, has forced Europe’s carmakers to slash fixed costs and streamline their model portfolios. Ford Europe has been losing money for years and pressure to restructure its operations increased after arch-rival General Motors G.M raised profits by selling its European Opel and Vauxhall brands to France’s Peugeot SA. Ford said it would close three plants in Russia, a plant in France and Wales, and cut shifts at factories in Valencia, Spain and Saarlouis, Germany. Following the sale of the Kechnec Transmission plant in Slovakia, to Magna, Ford’s manufacturing footprint will be reduced to 18 facilities by end-2020, from 24 today. "We have largely concluded consultations with social partners regarding restructuring actions," Stuart Rowley, president, Ford of Europe told Reuters. --Reuters--
