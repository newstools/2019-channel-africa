During her tenure, SAA dropped the profitable SA to Mumbai route to allow India Jet airways entry. She is expected to shed more light regarding how SAA lost the route to the Gupta family-operated airline. On Tuesday, the commission heard evidence from Head of Fuel Management at SAA, Mark Vaughan, explaining how a strong push for transformation by the SAA Board to involve smaller players in the jet fuel procurement space, was a bad idea. He explained how buying fuel from the smaller players cost more for SAA rather than procuring 100% directly from oil major producing companies with refineries like BP, Shell and Total. The Board set aside 15% jet fuel procurement from emerging businesses. The decision allowed oil major companies to give SAA 85% of Jet fuel and 15% was reserved for smaller companies.
