In the ballot of Conservative MPs, former London mayor Johnson secured more than twice the number of votes won by his nearest challengers as three of the ten candidates were eliminated from the race. The outcome of the leadership battle could determine under what conditions Britain leaves the European Union. It is currently scheduled to leave on October 31. Johnson has said he is open to leaving the EU on October 31 without a formal deal between London and Brussels but would prefer to secure one by the deadline. Opponents of "no-deal" say it would cause economic chaos as Britain breaks up with its top trading partners. Thursday's vote was Conservative MPs' first secret ballot in the governing party's leadership contest. Johnson secured 114 votes, way ahead of Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt on 43 and Environment Secretary Michael Gove with 37. Former Brexit secretary Dominic Raab (27), interior minister Sajid Javid (23), Health Secretary Matt Hancock (20) and International Development Secretary Rory Stewart (19) also survived the cut. Like Johnson, Raab and Javid have said they would not rule out a "no-deal" Brexit. --AFP--
