The Canadians, aged 19 and 20, were abducted on June 4 in Kumasi, Ghana's second largest city, located some 200 kilometres northwest of the capital Accra. "National Security Operatives in the early hours of Wednesday 12 June, 2019 completed an operation which successfully rescued the two Canadian women recently abducted" in Kumasi, Information Minister Kojo Oppong Nkrumah said in a statement. "Citizens and travellers are once again assured that Ghana remains safe". They had been travelling in an Uber with a third Canadian woman. When they reached their destination, the pair got out of the taxi first and was taken. The third woman then went to alert the police with the Uber driver. Police said the women were volunteers with Youth Challenge International, a Canadian international development organisation headquartered in Toronto. Abductions and violent crime towards foreigners are relatively rare in Ghana. In 2018, three Ghanaian women were kidnapped in the southern port of Takoradi. In April 2018, an Indian man was reportedly abducted, also in Kumasi, by an armed gang demanding a cash ransom. He was swiftly rescued by police. The Estonian consul was also briefly abducted in April, but released soon after. --AFP--
