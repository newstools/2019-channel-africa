Anderson is number eight on the ATP Tour standings but received a higher seeding because Wimbledon organisers take into account players' form on grass when they make their seedings. Anderson, last year's runner-up at Wimbledon, has struggled with an elbow injury for much of 2019 and made his return to action at last weekend's Queen's Club Championships in London where he was beaten in the second round by Frenchman Gilles Simon. World number one and defending champion Novak Djokovic is the top seed on the men's side, followed by eight-time champion and world number three Roger Federer. Rafael Nadal, the world number two and recent French Open champion, is seeded below Federer. On the doubles side, South Africa's Raven Klaasen and his New Zealand partner Michael Venus are the third seeds. Klaasen and Venus were beaten finalists at last year's Wimbledon. On the women's side, recent French Open winner and world number one Ashleigh Barty is the top seed. Five-time former champion Serena Williams is the 11th seed.
