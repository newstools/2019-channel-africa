This follows the bold decision by the Zanu-PF Youth League to name people accused corruption in the country. Speaking at a Press briefing after the 330th Ordinary Session of the Politburo in Harare yesterday, Zanu-PF Secretary for Information and Publicity Cde Simon Khaya Moyo said the President will set up a commission of inquiry to investigate the corruption allegations. “The Press statement by the Zanu-PF national youth executive league on corruption allegations at a Press conference on Monday was debated by Politburo members extensively Several members of the Politburo made their observations and contributions. Whilst the Youth League may not have followed proper procedures in issuing their statement on Monday, there was urgent need to pronounce at all levels zero tolerance on corruption,” said Moyo. The Politburo, Moyo said, discussed extensively on the need to call for zero tolerance on corruption which is bleeding the country’s economy. “This cancerous malady called corruption must be eradicated once and for all. Appropriate measures must be taken to clean the party and the nation at large on corruption. This, of course, includes Government and the private sector,” he added. Moyo said the Politburo described corruption as a veld fire which affects the country’s economy. Mnangagwa has made several warnings that seem to have fallen on deaf ears. --Herald--
