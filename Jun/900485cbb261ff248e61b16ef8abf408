But his extraordinary success, his victory was his sixth in eight races in 2019 prompted a negative reaction in some quarters from critics who find Mercedes' domination "boring" and the races lacking in suspense and thrills. Hamilton, who admits his success feels "unreal", said Sunday he understood if spectators, or the global broadcast audience, lost interest but urged them to blame the sport's rules, not the drivers. "We need to see a dramatic overhaul," he said, adding that the structure of the sport's management was also in need of change. He added: "It's really important that people realise it's not the drivers fault -– this is a constant cycle of F1 for years and years. And before I got to F1. It's because the way Bernie (Ecclestone) had it set up and the decisions they made then. "Until that structure changes, it will be the same in my opinion." As Hamilton and Mercedes continue their relentless destruction of the records, it is unreasonable to ask his team to slow down, as the president of the sport's ruling body, the International Motoring Federation (FIA) Jean Todt, once the boss of the all-conquering team that powered Michael Schumacher to five of his seven titles, has pointed out. "It is beautiful to see 20 cars at a marvellous circuit, truly modern, a real motor racing circuit, with the best teams and the best drivers in the world," he said.
