The operation late Monday came after police clashed with opposition supporters angered over the declared victory of ruling party candidate Mohamed Ould Ghazouani, they said. A former general and long-time ally of outgoing president Mohamed Ould Abdel Aziz, Ghazouani was credited with 52% of the ballot, averting the need for a runoff vote. "Police arrived at the headquarters of candidate Biram (Ould Dah Ould Abeid) and tossed teargas grenades inside, smashing windows and doors, making the place unusable," Abeid's spokesman, Hammada Ould Lehbouss, said on Tuesday. They also raided the headquarters of opposition candidate Kane Hamidou Baba, the four candidates told a press conference late Monday. His premises were closed by the authorities, opposition sources said on Tuesday. The two buildings, located close to each other in the capital Nouakchott, were deserted early Tuesday and rocks used to form roadblocks and burned tyres were scattered outside, an AFP reporter saw. The government refused to comment. The vote on Saturday had been touted as a historic moment in the conservative Saharan desert nation, marking its first democratic transition after decades of coups. Ghazouani easily beat Abeid, an anti-slavery activist credited with 18.58% of the vote, according to results published by the CENI electoral commission. He was followed by Sidi Mohamed Ould Boubacar, a former prime minister, with 17.87%, according to the official figures. Kane polled 8.71%, while Mohamed Ould Moloud got 2.44%.
