The move is being challenged in court over the fact that it features a statue of the country's first President, Jomo Kenyatta. The constitution says notes should not feature the portrait of an individual. But the withdrawal of the old 1 000 Shilling note by October 1 has been a bigger source of disquiet. On Monday morning, the central bank defended its right to withdraw the currency after the court challenge. Bank Governor, Patrick Njoroge, says the so-called demonetisation followed all applicable laws and called the court battle an inconvenience. He says there will be enough cash available countrywide to avoid a shortage. Some opposition politicians and ambassadors including the US and UK envoys have publicly endorsed this new legal tender, terming it as one more step towards curbing theft of government funds. Kenyatta has faced widespread criticism for large-scale corruption in his government and the demonetisation is seen as a direct response to that. Officials and well-connected businessmen in corrupt cartels are believed hold hundreds of millions of illegally obtained Shillings in cash. Withdrawing the 1 000 Shilling note is expected to close many money laundering avenues as the old notes have to be exchanged for the new notes. Demonetisation has happened in other parts of the world such as when the European Union adopted the euro. In Nigeria, an anti-corruption crackdown was conducted by Muhammadu Buhari in 1984 when he was military head of state that saw old notes banned. Ghana did the same in 1982 to help with tax evasion. In 2016, Indiaâ€™s 1.3 billion people experienced a currency change overnight, exposing the country to months of financial difficulties. The Indian government however maintains that demonetisation was necessary and they saw huge success with handling tax evasion, cutting terrorism funding, and moving towards a cashless economy. --BBC--
