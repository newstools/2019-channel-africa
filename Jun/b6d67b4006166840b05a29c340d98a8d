Uber said the new production XC90 will be assembled by Volvo Cars in Sweden and have human controls like steering wheels and brake pedals, but added it has factory-installed steering and braking systems designed for computer rather than human control. Previously, Uber had purchased about 250 Volvo XC90 SUVs and retrofitted them for self-driving use. The new vehicles - known by the internal code number 519Gand under development for several years - are safer, more reliable and will "soon" replace the older vehicles in Uber's fleet, said Eric Meyhofer, the head of Uber's Advanced Technologies Group. "This is about going to production," said Meyhofer in an interview at an Uber conference in Washington Tuesday. The new vehicle also has several back-up systems. --Reuters--
