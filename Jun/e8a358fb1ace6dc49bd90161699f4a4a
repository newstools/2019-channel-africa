Abdellah Benaoum has been transferred to the intensive care unit of a hospital in the western city of Sidi Bel Abbas. He was sentenced to two years in prison for insulting former-president Abdelaziz Bouteflika, who has since been forced to resign following massive street protests. Opposition figures were outraged last month after the death of another hunger striking prisoner, the human rights activist, Kamaleddine Fekhar. --BBC--
