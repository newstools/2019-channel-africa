Topped by world champions Andy Birkett and Hank McGregor, the team of seniors, under 23 and junior athletes for the trip to the Far East will include two black paddlers in Alex Masina, who won a bronze in the junior boys K1 race in 2017 at the World Champs in Pietermaritzburg, and Under 18 girl Nosipho Mthembu, who will paddle in the U18 Girls K2 race with Amy Peckett. Marathon paddling is arguably the strongest canoeing discipline for South Africa on a global scale and they currently house the K1 and K2 men's senior World Champion in Birkett, however coming out of retirement in a K1 at the national trial was 13-time World Champion McGregor. The veteran has won eight K1 gold medals, four K2 golds and one K2 silver medal, didn't compete in the K1 race at the 2018 World Championships but won the K2 showdown with Birkett. Birkett got the better of the legend at the Cradle Moon Lake during the South African championships, however McGregor is as experienced as they come and will put in a strong fight for another gold medal. With only two boats in each category qualifying the racing at the national championships is fierce and the K2 racing was no exception. Birkett and McGregor won the race by a whisker over the young, exciting Under-23 duo of Alex Masina and Louis Hattingh. In the senior women's class it was Bridgitte Hartley who won the national championships and will represent South Africa once again at the world champs. She will be joined by a former Under-23 medallist Jenna Ward who has shown that she is getting back to her best. In the K2 racing at the showpiece in the East, Hartley and Christie Mackenzie will be the one senior women's crew representing South Africa while former world championship silver medallists Jenna Ward and Kyeta Purchase will be the other South African boat in the race.Â
