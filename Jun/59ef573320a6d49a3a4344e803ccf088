Facebook has been soliciting feedback over the past six months from more than 650 people at workshops in 88 countries on its draft plan for the board, which it says will function as an independent court of appeals on content decisions. Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg has said decisions about acceptable speech on Facebook’s suite of social networks - used by some 2.4 billion people worldwide - should not rest in the company’s hands alone. The company will finalize the board’s charter in August, it said. According to the report, attendees at the workshops broadly agreed that Facebook employees should not sit on the board. The company also should not be able to remove members without cause, and should clarify how it would define “cause,” they said. --Reuters--
