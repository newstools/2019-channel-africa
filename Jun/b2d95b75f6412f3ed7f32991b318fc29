Stock in the unit, which is not listed on any of the German indexes, started at VW's initial price of $30.70. The flotation brought in around $2 billion. With Traton, "the second-largest IPO in Europe so far this year has taken place in Germany" after Italian payment processor Nexi, EY analysts noted ahead of the stock market opening. Traton sold some 233 000 vehicles in 2018, with its 81 000 employees bringing in almost $28 billion in revenue. It brings together well-known brands MAN (Germany) and Scania (Sweden) as well as VW-branded trucks sold in South America and Africa. Bosses hope to compete more strongly with Daimler and Volvo by finding savings and pressing for a faster-paced global expansion. VW had already set the price tag for the 57.5 million shares on offer, an 11.5% stake at the very bottom of the range of between 27 and 33 euros it first mooted weeks before, valuing the company at 13.5 billion. In Stockholm, where Traton is also listed, the shares fell to trade at 280 Swedish kronor $30.16. --AFP--
