Guterres made the appeal in a report circulated on Monday ahead of the UN Security Council's unanimous approval of a resolution authorising the inspection of vessels on the high seas headed to or from Libya for another year to enforce the arms embargo. The European Union's Operation Sophia has been the only regional naval operation carrying out inspections. UN experts monitoring the arms embargo, individual countries, and regional organisations "have all reported on illicit transfers of arms and related materiel into and out of Libya", Guterres noted. Implementing all measures related to the arms embargo is "of immediate importance in de-escalating the current situation" and is "of critical importance to the protection of civilians and the restoration of security and stability in Libya and the region", the secretary-general said. Civil war in Libya in 2011 toppled and later killed long-time dictator Muammar Gaddafi. The chaos that followed resulted in a divided country, with a UN-recognised but weak administration in the capital of Tripoli overseeing the country's west, and a rival government in the east aligned with the Libyan National Army, led by military commander Khalifa Haftar. Each is backed by an array of militias and armed groups fighting over resources and territory. Haftar launched a military offensive in early April, aimed at taking Tripoli despite commitments to move towards elections in the North African country. Clashes receded during last month's start of the Muslim holy month of Ramadan, but later intensified. Britain's political director, Stephen Hickey, whose country sponsored the UN resolution, expressed deep concern after the vote at "the now protracted and escalating conflict", which has led to a deteriorating security and humanitarian situation in Libya.Â
