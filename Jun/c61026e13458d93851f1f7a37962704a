Earlier this year, Standard Bank said it would close 91 of its branches. But this has now been increased to 104–17% of all its branches. Gauteng will be worst hit, with 49 branches due to close by as early as this month. Branches in a number of key locations, including Hyde Park, East Rand Mall, the Mbombela branch, Mitchell’s Plain and Hout Bay, will be closed. Standard Bank initially expected 1 200 of its staff to be affected by the closures, but given the expanded list, more people could lose their jobs. --BusinessInsider--
