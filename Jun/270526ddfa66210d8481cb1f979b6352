According to the Governor of Lualaba province the accident occurred at an open pit mine. The area is known to be unstable and the miners were working illegally without proper equipment, BBC says. This kind of unofficial, or clandestine, mining is common in the area and people do it as a means to make a living. Efforts by security services to try and stop it are often fruitless. The owner of the mine where the accident happened, Glencore, says that while it protects its own workers it cannot ensure the safety of those who are not supposed to be there. --BBC--
