The South China Morning Post reported that the United States and China were laying out an agreement that would help avert the next round of tariffs on an additional $300 billion of Chinese imports. "The trade truce is what the market needs right now," said Art Hogan, chief market strategist at National Securities in New York. "The message is that they’re not going to escalate further from here on and we’re now in neutral territory. What investors are hoping for now is that the meeting diffuses some of the tension." However, a Wall Street Journal report that Chinese President Xi Jinping planned to present President Donald Trump with a set of terms Washington should meet before Beijing is ready to settle their trade dispute tempered optimism.
