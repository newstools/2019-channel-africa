Tens of thousands of military and police were deployed in the capital of the world's third-biggest democracy amid fears of more unrest after Thursday's decision, as protesters gathered outside the Constitutional Court. The court is weighing ex-general Prabowo Subianto's claims that the April poll was plagued by "systematic, structured and massive" electoral fraud that cost him victory. His lawyers have sought to overturn the official results that declared incumbent Joko Widodo the winner with 55.5% of votes, against Subianto's 44.5%. But Subianto's legal team argued that Widodo mobilised the power of the state to win the vote and broke campaign finance rules, and that up to 30 million votes were "stolen". Over the course of more than eight hours Thursday, the nine-judge panel painstakingly described many of the allegations -- including vote buying and that biased civil servants favoured Widodo as baseless. The court, which also questioned the quality of the evidence and the credibility of witnesses, said voter-fraud claims were the responsibility of Bawaslu, the elections supervisory agency, and beyond its remit. It was not immediately clear at what time the final ruling would be delivered.
