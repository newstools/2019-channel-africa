Lampard has emerged as the favourite to replace Maurizio Sarri at Chelsea, after the Italian joined Serie A champions Juventus earlier this month. "With pre-season fast approaching for both clubs it is hoped this will allow Chelsea to swiftly conclude their discussions," Derby said in a statement, adding they would not comment further until it was appropriate to do so. Lampard, who won three Premier League titles and the Champions League as a player at Chelsea, led Derby to the Championship playoff final last season in his first year in management. --Reuters--
