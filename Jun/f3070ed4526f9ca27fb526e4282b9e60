They are accusing the government of carrying out an electoral hold up to impose its candidate General Mohamed Ould Ghazouani in the first round of polls. At a press conference on Wednesday, the four candidates Kane Hamidou Baba, Sidi Mohamed Ould Boubacar, Biram dah Abeid and Mohamed Ould Maouloud say President Mohamed Ould Abdel Azizâ€™s government is responsible for the post-electoral crisis the country is going through that has led to the massive arrests of their supporters. The electoral commission declared last week the government-backed candidate Ghazouani won the presidency with 52% of the votes. --AfricaNews--
