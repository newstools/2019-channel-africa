Bafana are just under three weeks away from meeting Ivory Coast in their first match of the tournament yet have only one friendly match arranged against Ghana before then. The national team are set to leave for Dubai on June 10 to face the West African side but it seems it could be the only preparation game Baxter's men will have. As such, the Englishman hinted that the South African Football Association had left things late in terms of planning. He said: "Unfortunately, we've got no definite plans yet. We're still trying but it's looking a little bit forlorn. "It's too last-minute. It's too much at the last minute trying to solve all the problems, so it's just not happening. We're not getting the (logistics sorted). "I suppose if we were to pay for three days in a hotel for any of the COSAFA teams and fly them up [to Johannesburg] in first-class, we'd get a lot of people that want to play. "But for the conditions that we've got at the last minute, I think it's probably not too interesting for them. I'll push until the last minute (to secure a friendly), because I think we need it." SAFA are said to be in discussions with Uganda and Angola regarding arranging some friendlies which could take place in either Dubai or Egypt.
