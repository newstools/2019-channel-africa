The government believes the attacks were carried out by members of the Fulani community against ethnic Dogons. It was the latest in a series of inter-communal attacks in recent months. Ethnic tensions in central Mali have surged after a jihadist group led by preacher Amadou Koufa emerged in 2015, recruiting mainly from among the Fulani. Clashes have increased with Dogon and Bambara groups who have formed their own militias. President Ibrahim Boubacar Keita has called for an end to violence, but has been criticised for failing to curb it. --BBC--
