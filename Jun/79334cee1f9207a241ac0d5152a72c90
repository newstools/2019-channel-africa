Carlos Sainz of McLaren and Renault’s Nico Hulkenberg made clear their views against the penalty, which cost Vettel a vital victory for Ferrari, and were backed by Max Verstappen of Red Bull. All three, however, said they did not blame the stewards, but the rules. Talking to reporters at the French grand Prix weekend Hulkenberg said: "My opinion is that it's just racing, it’s hard to control a car on grass and when you make re-entry to the track. We are simply not in full control and don’t have normal grip. "So, for me it’s a racing incident. In terms of the rules, there are different judgments every weekend from the stewards." Vettel, who went on to win the Canadian race 'on the road', was given a five-second penalty for his unsafe re-entry after running off across a strip of grass, a move that handed victory to Lewis Hamilton and Mercedes. The stewards’ decision may be reviewed if Ferrari introduces new evidence at a hearing scheduled to take place at Le Castellet on Friday. Sainz said that "like any other F1 fan, I was disappointed with the penalty, I would have done the same as Seb. We would just rejoin the track and try to keep first position. "Was it dangerous? Potentially. But what is not dangerous in F1? "There is always a bit of danger. You are always close to the walls and I don’t think at any point Lewis was under threat of having a huge accident. --News24--
