Morsi, a leading member of the Muslim Brotherhood group, which is now banned in Egypt, suffered a fatal heart attack in a Cairo court on Monday while on trial on espionage charges. "I believe the UN will put Morsi's suspicious death on its agenda and hold those responsible accountable,"Erdogan said in a speech at a rare news conference with foreign journalists in Istanbul. Erdogan has vowed to seek the Egyptian government's "trial" in international courts over Morsi's death, calling on the Organisation of Islamic Co-operation to act. He also called Morsi a "martyr" and said he did not believe he died due to natural causes. Egypt's foreign ministry denounced Erdogan's comments on Thursday, calling them "crude violations" against Egypt. The 67-year-old Morsi, the first democratically elected head of state in Egypt's modern history, had been in jail since the army commanded by Egypt's current president Abdel Fattah al-Sisi toppled him in 2013 after barely a year in power following mass protests against his rule. Erdogan's Islamist-rooted AK Party supported Morsi s short-lived Egyptian government, and many Brotherhood members and supporters have fled to Turkey since its activities were banned in Egypt.
