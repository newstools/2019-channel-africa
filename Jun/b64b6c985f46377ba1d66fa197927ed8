The social networking giant has linked with 28 partners including Mastercard, PayPal and Uber to form Libra Association, a Geneva-based entity governing the new digital coin, according to marketing materials and interviews with executives. 

No banks are yet part of the group. To facilitate transactions, Facebook also created Calibra, a subsidiary that will offer digital wallets to save, send and spend Libras. 

Calibra will be connected to Facebook messaging platforms Messenger and WhatsApp. The whole system is scheduled to launch in the first half of 2020.
