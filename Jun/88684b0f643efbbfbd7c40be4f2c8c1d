Finance Minister Dr Phillip Mpango, in the 2019/20 budget speech, said the government would amend duty rates for non-petroleum products to reduce the tax burden on industry. But Mpango raised registration fees for vehicles, motorcycles and rickshaw tricycles, saying the government is looking to raise $8 million. Driving licence fees were raised from $17 to $30, and the percentage of duty on artificial hair and plastic also rose. In May, President John Magufuli said the government is more focused on economic and infrastructure projects than on salary increases. Critics say the budget is not pro-poor, because it does not touch on wages and salaries. The government is also looking to attract investors in manufacturing and raise the industrial contribution to the national economy from the current seven per cent to 15 % in the next six years. --TheEastAfrican--
