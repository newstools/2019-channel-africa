Forces led by Khalifa Haftar launched an offensive on Tripoli in early April but the assault has stalled in the face of resistance from local armed groups aligned with the United Nations-recognized government in Tripoli. Haftar and his backers say they are trying to free the capital from the yoke of militias which they blame for destabilizing Libya since the fall of Muammar Gaddafi in a NATO-backed uprising in 2011. Haftar’s critics accuse him of trying to seize power through force and deepening a conflict between factions based in the east and in the west of the sprawling North African country. The campaign on Tripoli has left at least 653 dead and displaced more than 93 000, according to the United Nations, as well as causing extensive material damage.  

Aguila Saleh, head of a parliament that relocated to eastern Libya in 2014 during a previous battle for Tripoli, said “the campaign to liberate Tripoli is not easy”.
