Schmidt was part of the German national team that contested the World Marathon Championships at Camps Drift in Pietermaritzburg in 2017, and the young paddler from Munich has blossomed as a long distance racer since then. In 2018 he produced a shock win in the gruelling three day 180 km flat water race in the Czech Republic from Budejovice to Praha, where he toppled Petr Mojžíšek, the man who has traditionally dominated the race, after which talked turned to the pair teaming up for the Berg in 2019. The 23-year-old chemical engineering student from Technical University of Munich says that his interest in the Berg River Canoe Marathon goes back to 2013 when he started following the challenge from some of the top European paddlers. "That was actually the first time I watched the race and since then it has been a dream of mine to participate In the Berg," said Schmidt. "The Berg is such an iconic race with big names stepping on the podium like Andy Birkett, Hank McGregor and Graeme Solomon, but I have been watching the Europeans in recent years, paddlers like Kiko Vega, Adrián Boros and indeed Petr Mojžíšek, and to see impressive paddlers like Ben Brown who couldn't finish the race cleanly." Racing and beating Mojžíšek in the Budejovice to Praha race was a turning point for the German after a year fraught with glandular fever and then breaking an ankle that kept him out of the boat, and missing selection for the German marathon team. --News24--
