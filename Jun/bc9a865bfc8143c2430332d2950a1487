Mbeki was speaking on South Africa’s SABC News last week, where he said President Mnangagwa had set a good example for fellow African countries, and slated MDC-Alliance leader Nelson Chamisa for spurning the dialogue. He expressed frustration that the opposition leader was intransigent despite the outcome of the elections and the Constitutional Court ruling, removing the basis of Chamisa’s claims of the supposed illegitimacy of the winner. ‘‘So, I’m saying that something should happen because what President Mnangagwa has done is correct and I’m saying MDC agreed in principle to this, so let them find a way together because you go through the courts as happened in Zimbabwe and as happening in Malawi to resolve whatever are the contested things, but after that you must address this matter,’’ he said. Mbeki who is no stranger to Zimbabwean affairs having mediated the inter-party dialogue that led to the formation of the inclusive Government in 2009 urged compatriots to come together and work towards a better Zimbabwe. He said the call for dialogue, as well as unity of purpose shown by President Mnangagwa to resolve political and socio-economic issues affecting the country, was the way to go and every Zimbabwean should be involved. President Mnangagwa is on record as calling for all peace-loving Zimbabweans to come forward with views and other developmental ideas that can make Zimbabwe a great nation again. Mbeki noted that national issues require collective minds.  --Herald--
