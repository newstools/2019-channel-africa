The West Africans had seen their most capped player and record goal-scorer Asamoah Gyan retire from national team duty last month, in protest of not being named captain by coach Kwasi Appiah. But after a plea by Ghanaian president Nana Addo Dankwa Akufo-Addo, the 33-year-old striker reversed his decision and will now line up at the finals under the leadership of Andre and Jordan Ayew. Ofori says the squad are united behind the pair. The 2019 AFCON finals kick-off next Friday in Egypt with Ghana drawn in Group F, alongside Cameroon, Guinea-Bissau and Benin, who they meet in their first match on June 25. Ofori is looking forward to the competition, which will be the second of his career having been in the 2017 team that finished fourth in Gabon. --SABC--
