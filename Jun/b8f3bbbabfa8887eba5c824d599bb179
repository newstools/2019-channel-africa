Speaking at the firm's headquarters, Ren also said the company would slash production by $30 billion. Last month, the US put Huawei on a list of companies that American firms cannot trade with unless they have a licence. The move marked an escalation in efforts by Washington to block Huawei. The US argues that the Chinese company - the world's largest maker of telecoms equipment and the second biggest smartphone maker - poses a security risk. "In the coming two years, the company will cut production by $30 billion," Ren said at a panel discussion at the firm's headquarters in Shenzhen. Sales are now expected to remain flat at $100 billion in 2019 and 2020. Earlier this year, Huawei had predicted sales of about $125 billion for 2019. However, Ren said the company would "regain its vitality" in 2021. He also said that while overseas smartphone sales had dropped sharply, in China growth remained "very fast". Spending on research and development would not be cut, Ren added, despite the anticipated hit to the firm's finances. --BBC--
