President Emmerson Mnangagwa's government said the move on Monday to abandon a multi-currency system was an important step towards removing economic imbalances. But many Zimbabweans are distrustful after a long succession of failed economic interventions. "If the government does not reverse this ruinous policy immediately and announce US dollar salary payments, we will immediately mobilise workers for mass action," Zimbabwe Congress of Trade Unions (ZCTU) president Peter Mutasa told a news conference. In January, the ZCTU led nationwide protests against a 150%fuel price increase, triggering a violent crackdown by the army and police, which left at least 12 people dead, according to rights groups. Mnangagwa replaced long-time leader Robert Mugabe after an army coup in November 2017, but a hoped-for economic turnaround has not materialised. In February, Mnangagwa's government introduced the RTGS dollar as a transitional unit before launching the Zimbabwean dollar.
