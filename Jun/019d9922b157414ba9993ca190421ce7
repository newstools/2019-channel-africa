A shaky start on the 10th - which saw him make bogey on his opening hole threatened to derail his round but he bounced back in style, birdieing three holes in a row. Three pars later he made another birdie, this time on the 17th which was his eighth, as he turned in 33. "I can't really complain," he said of his second round. "it is tough to go low and try to shoot a good score to back that up. I managed to do a decent round, I think. I didn't really do much wrong, so pretty much everything was good, really." His back nine was just as solid because almost similar to Thursday's run on those first four holes of the golf course, he went on a sweet birdie-run there; making three in a row. For the remaining holes, the Zimbabwean held on steadily, making six straight pars to consolidate his lead. "It was very nice going birdie-birdie-birdie after that drop. I had a good chance on 14 as well but just kind of left it in the mouth. Then 15, I feel like I should have made a birdie there but couldnâ€™t up-and-down from the front. A nice start to the front nine, a little birdie-birdie-birdie again. I'm pretty satisfied with six-under," Ferreira said. Hot on his heels is member of the Gary Player Class Toto Thimba whose scintillating nine-under 63 catapulted him to second on the leader board at 13-under-par for the week. He opened his round with back-to-back pars on the 10th and 11th before picking up a birdie on the 12th, his third hole of the day. A drop on his fifth - the 14th hole of the course - was quickly forgotten as he went on to make three birdies in the last four holes of that front nine of his. He turned on the magic after the turn, going on a run of four consecutive birdies from the first hole - his 10th - through the fourth, his 13th. Then, one on six and another on seven as he went out in 30. --News24--
