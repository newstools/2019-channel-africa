The 43-year-old former world number one is hunting a 16th major at this week's US Open at Pebble Beach, two months after crowning his comeback from injury with victory at the Masters. But Woods acknowledged on Tuesday that he is excited by the possibility of challenging for Olympic honours at Tokyo 2020, where golf will be a medal sport once more after a successful return in 2016. "Olympic gold medal would be a hell of a feat," Woods said. "First I need to qualify. It would be exciting if I got a chance to represent the United States in the Olympic Games." Woods was battling back injuries at the time of the 2016 games in Rio de Janeiro, and was never in contention for earning an Olympic berth. For the 2020 Olympics, qualification will be based on the world rankings, with the top 15 players in the rankings assured of a berth, with a limit of four golfers per country. A total of 60 players will play in the men's event. On current standings, world number five Woods would claim one of the four United States of America spots as the third highest ranked American player. --News24--
