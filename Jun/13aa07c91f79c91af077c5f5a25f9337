The duo was two of the four golfers who were in the Top 20 of the Race to Dubai rankings after the BMW International Open, who hadn't already qualified for the final Major championship. Sterne, who is ranked at 143rd, currently sits 16th on the Race to Dubai rankings after his runner-up finish at the Abu Dhabi Championship and a T9 finish at the Trophee Hassan II. The six-time European Tour winner will be making his eighth Open appearance after missing out last season. Van Rooyen made his Major debut at Carnoustie last year with a Top 20 finish. Van Rooyen, who is currently 84th in the world rankings, has been in fine form after his T8 at the PGA Championship. Sterne and Van Rooyen will join two-time Major champion Ernie Els, 2010 Open winner Louis Oosthuizen, Justin Harding, Zander Lombard, Shaun Norris and Brandon Stone. --News24--
