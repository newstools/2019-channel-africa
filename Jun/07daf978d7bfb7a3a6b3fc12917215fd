New remote fields and criminal gangs boosted production in the world's top supplier, despite efforts to steer rural communities away from coca cultivation following a peace deal with FARC rebels. "Of course it's bad news every time. It's bad news for the producing countries. What is happening in Columbia is worrisome," said Angela Me, chief of research of the Vienna-based United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC). The report said the jump in production "was mainly driven by increases in cocaine manufacture in Colombia, which produced an estimated 70 per cent of the world's cocaine". In the decade to 2017, there was a 50% increase in manufacture, reaching a record 1 976 tons two years ago, according to the report, which bases its figures on national monitoring systems. Over the same ten-year period, the amount of cocaine seized worldwide rose by 74%. In 2017, authorities across the globe intercepted a record quantity of the drug: in all 1 275 tons were seized, up 13% year-on-year. "This suggests that law enforcement efforts have become more effective and that strengthened international cooperation may be helping to increase interception rates," the report said. Almost 90% of seizures were in the Americas, with Colombia alone intercepting 38% of the global total in 2017. Cocaine production in some central areas of Colombia dropped following the 2016 peace deal with the former Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, or FARC, as farmers were offered alternatives to growing coca bush. But the report said Colombia has since seen more coca cultivation, with new fields,often far away from major cities -- being planted and criminal groups moving into areas previously controlled by the rebels.
