Nadal's mastery of the red clay has put him in a league of his own on the surface for more than a decade, yet Eurosport analyst Wilander suggests there could still be more to come from the Spaniard. "Rafa didn't even have the perfect clay court season which is scary," stated Wilander. "The way he hit his backhand in the final tells me he's still working at his game and developing another way of playing. "I thought after the second set maybe Rafa's feeling a little tired, so he just started stepping in and taking his backhand early which surprised Dominic a little bit. The match was over from that point. "The first two sets against Thiem were insane. It lived up to expectations which, to me, were by far the best two sets of the men's tournament. It was crucial for Thiem to get a good start. "After the second set I thought the momentum was with Thiem and somehow Nadal just grabbed it out of his hands. "Maybe the bathroom break helped but there was a big difference in the third set. I think Thiem ran out of steam in the third set, he just relaxed a little bit and lost his intensity. Maybe he was just happy to have won a set in a Grand Slam final and he lost the creativity that he had in the first two sets." Wilander's fellow Eurosport analyst John McEnroe suggested he was surprised by Nadal's tactics in the final, as he suspected the King of Clay might shake uphill game to combat the threat of Thiem. "I actually thought Rafa would go back to what he used to do earlier in his career and play it safer," stated former Wimbledon champion McEnroe. --News24--
