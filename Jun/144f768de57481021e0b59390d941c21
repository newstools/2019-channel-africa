The administration believes that a rising number of thefts are being committed by people on motorbikes. Addis Ababa Deputy Mayor Takele Uma said motorbike owners have just over a fortnight to find alternative transport before the ban comes into effect on 7 July. In recent years, motorbikes have become increasingly popular in the city as a means to avoid traffic jams, but there they are not as commonly seen as in many other African cities such as Nairobi. Embassies and the postal service will not be affected by the ban. --BBC-
