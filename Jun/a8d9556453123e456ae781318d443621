The creatures died at a site in the north of the country and the authorities are trying to decontaminate the area. The statement does not go into details as to why this may have happened, but AFP news agency reports that poachers are known to deliberately target vultures. It says that vultures are used by park rangers to help track illegal poaching, therefore getting rid of the birds means that they are less likely to be found. The government said that among the 537 vultures killed were 468 white-backed vultures, 28 hooded vultures, 17 white-headed vultures, 14 lappet-faced vultures, 10 cape vultures. It has called on people in the area to report "any suspicious activities". In May, Botswana lifted a ban on elephant hunting, citing growing conflict between humans and the animals, which at times destroy crops. Critics of the ban, imposed in 2014, say the restriction was causing problems to small farmers and to those who previously benefited from hunting. --BBC--
