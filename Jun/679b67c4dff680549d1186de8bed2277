Many Sudanese save their money in form of gold. Due to protests and the tensions in the country since President Omar al-Bashir was ousted, more people are selling off their gold savings for cash to survive. “People come to sell more than we buy, because of the situation we have been living in. to sell because they have no more cash,” said Bachir Abdallah Ali, jewellery shop owner. Gold business in Sudan seems to be booming as more people exchange the precious metal for cash as the country's economic crisis shows no sign of slowing down. For dozens of Jewelery shops in Khatourm, the high business has not meant more profits as gold prices have fallen. Violent clashes between Sudan’s military council and pro-democracy protesters have led to a deadlock on negotiations on a transition, which some believe could deliver an economic recovery. --AfricaNews--
