In part of a tweet that has now been deleted, the US embassy blamed the Sudanese military for the violence and said it could not responsibly lead the people of Sudan. The European Union called on Sudan's military leaders to allow people to protest peacefully and urged a speedy transfer of power to civilians. The British Foreign Secretary, Jeremy Hunt, described the attack on protesters as an outrageous step that he said would lead to more polarisation and violence. Egypt, which is a key ally of the transitional military council in Sudan, was less critical of the violence, but called for calm and a return to dialogue. --BBC--
