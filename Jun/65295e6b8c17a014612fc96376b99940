Maas, on a visit to Tehran, also insisted that the deal which has been hanging in the balance since the United States unilaterally withdrew from it in 2018 was "extraordinarily important" for Europe. Iran signed the landmark accord with China, Russia, Germany, Britain, France and the US, leading to sanctions relief in exchange for Tehran curbing its nuclear programme. But the US administration of President Donald Trump has imposed sweeping sanctions on Iran after walking away from the deal formally known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA). On May 8, Iran retaliated by saying it no longer considered itself bound to keep to the limits of stocks of heavy water and enriched uranium that were agreed as part of the deal. Iran has also blamed the Europeans for not living up to their commitments. And it warned that it would stop by early July abiding by restrictions on the level to which it can enrich uranium and on modifications to its Arak heavy water reactor, unless other parties to the JCPOA speed up work on mitigating the effects of US sanctions. Maas met Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif Monday in Tehran to discuss the future of the nuclear deal. "We had a serious, frank and rather long discussion," Zarif told reporters at a joint news conference after talks with Maas.
