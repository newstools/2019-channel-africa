This is until the result of her Swiss appeal against the Court of Arbitration (CAS) ruling on the International Association of Athletics Federations’ (IAAF) testosterone levels decision for female athletes is made known. Semenya lost her appeal to the CAS and the IAAF implemented the rules that limited the testosterone levels of women running between 400 and 1500 metres within a week. After consultation and with the support of the South African government and Athletics South Africa (ASA), she announced last week that she will appeal that decision to the Swiss Federal Tribunal. That higher court has suspended the implementation of the controversial rules, pending the appeal. Lawyer Greg Nott says that’s likely to be at the earliest until the end of June. In the meantime, Semenya, Francine Niyonsaba and others affected can continue to compete.
