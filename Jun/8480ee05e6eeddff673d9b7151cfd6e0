In a press release on Tuesday the organisation said that the country did not have resources to cater for around 7500 Congolese refugees that had arrived in Uganda since the start of June, “placing strain on already badly overstretched facilities. Nearly two thirds are children, below 18 years in age”, the agency added. Uganda urgently needs resources to plug funding gaps left by a balance in their financial assistance for relief to refugees. “As we near the end of June, UNHCR and partners working on the refugee response in Uganda have received $150 million, 17% of the total $927 million needed,” said UNHCR Spokesperson, Andrej Mahecic, in Geneva. The inter-ethnic clashes in the north-eastern areas of DRC are driving people across the border into Uganda at a rate of 311 a day, more than double the rate of refugee arrivals in May (145 per day). UNHCR has said shelter and basic relief items are the urgent priority. In addition, buses and trucks are needed to transport refugees from border point reception centres to settlement areas. Many refugees need immediate psycho-social care and counselling for trauma. Refugees are arriving with significant belongings, due to fear that they would not be able to return home for some time, and others with little more than the clothes on their backs had recounted close encounters with extreme brutality. --TheEastAfrican--
