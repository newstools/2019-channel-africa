The appeal comes after former beauty queen Fatou "Toufah" Jallow told the BBC she had been raped by Jammeh when he was in office in 2015. The BBC has tried, without success, to contact Jammeh about the claims. He lives in exile in Equatorial Guinea. A spokesperson for his APRC party denied the accusations. "We as a party and the Gambian people are tired of the steady stream of unfounded allegations that have been reported against our ex-president," said Ousman Rambo Jatta, in a written statement to the BBC. "The ex-president has no time to react to lies and smear campaigns. He is a very respectable God-fearing and pious leader who has nothing but respect for our Gambian women," the deputy APRC leader said. Jallow, 23, told the BBC she wanted to meet Jammeh, 54, in court so he could face justice. Her testimony is part of a Human Rights Watch and Trial International report that details another alleged rape and sexual assault by Jammeh. Gambian Attorney General Abubacar Tambadou issued a statement praising the courage of Jallow. He said the ex-president abused his position as head of state to the detriment of many Gambians and called the reports of rape and sexual assault "despicable". A commission has now been set up to investigate reports of human rights violations committed during Jammeh's 22 years in office. Current President, Adama Barrow, has said he will await the commission's final report before pursuing requests for Jammeh's possible extradition from Equatorial Guinea. --BBC--
