Keet is in Stuart Baxter's 23-man squad for the tournament in Egypt where it appears he will be the starting number one for Bafana. South Africa are in tough group which includes Morocco, Namibia and Ivory Coast. The side are currently undergoing final preparations in Dubai where they are set to face Ghana on Saturday in a friendly. Keet told KickOff: "We want to give our best in this coming AFCON tournament. We know what we are capable of and we know what we want to do and we will try to go out and do it. We don't want to put too much expectations on what we can and can't do but the ultimate goal is achieving something for the country. "It is imperative that we do our best by putting all our plans into practice and that we work hard and maintain the form we had in the last few qualifiers. "I don't want to predict how far we can go, I think it all comes down to every match as we play it and we have to be prepared for every game. The results will take care of themselves but we need to start with a good foundation. "If we get it right, we will make the country proud. We have seen it with our clubs in the CAF Champions League competition that we have what it takes do well as South Africa. "Our national team is no different. We have a very good squad with good spirit and good mentality. We are looking at pushing as far as we can and as hard as we can and see how it goes." Bafana's first match in the competition is against Ivory Coast on 24 June. They then face Namibia on 28 June before their final game against Morocco on 1 July in the group stages. --News24--
