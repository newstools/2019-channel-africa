Senard told shareholders at Renault's AGM on Wednesday that board directors representing the French state, which owns 15% of the carmaker, had demanded more time to study the tie-up. "We did not derail the wedding between Renault and Fiat," French Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire told France Info radio ahead of a meeting with Renault chairman Jean-Dominique Senard. In particular the government wanted to clarify the future role of Renault's Japanese partners Nissan and Mitsubishi, which had been informed only at the last minute of the potential mega-merger with Fiat. "Rarely have I seen a merger project able to produce such significant synergies, and without having negative consequences in terms of jobs and livelihoods," Senard told shareholders. He also revealed that it was Le Maire himself who suggested he reach out to Fiat executives on a possible deal. But just over a week after proposing a merger that got a warm welcome from Renault and its investors, Fiat's president John Elkann said trying to push ahead with the deal would be "unreasonable". The deal's sudden collapse was a stunning blow to Senard, who was brought in just months ago to help get the carmaker back on track after the shock arrest of former Renault and Nissan boss Carlos Ghosn last November in Tokyo. --AFP--
