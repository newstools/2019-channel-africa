Steinhoff, which is also listed in Frankfurt, delayed the results after finding holes in its accounts in December 2017, shocking investors who had backed its reinvention from a small South African furniture outfit into a discount furniture retailer straddling four continents. The owner of Mattress Firm in the US, Fantastic chains in Australia and Conforama in France said the loss narrowed to $2 billion in the year ended September 2018 from $4 billion in fiscal 2017, as impairments came down. The retailer, with more than 12 400 stores, blamed one-off expenses including professional fees of $140 million and impairments for the loss as it cleans up its balance sheet after the fraud. Segmental operating profit from continuing operations and before capital items rose by 13% to $565 million. “During the reporting period the group and its operating entities had to deal with the consequences of the events at the Steinhoff parent company level. This had a severely negative impact on the group’s operational results,” the company said in its 328-page annual report posted on its website. An investigation by auditor PwC released in March found eight people, including former Steinhoff executives, were involved in a complex scheme where potential intercompany transactions worth $8 billion were fraudulently recorded as external income to prop up profits and hide costs in money-losing subsidiaries. Shares in Johannesburg-listed Steinhoff, which have tumbled more than 97% since December 2017, closed more than 2% higher. --Reuters--
