The surge in oil prices boosted share prices of energy companies, while global stock markets won support also from the prospect of US interest rate cuts in 2019. Rising hopes of a rate cut helped to offset lingering tensions over the long-running trade war between Washington and Beijing. Thursday's reported tanker attacks, the second incident involving shipping in the strategic sea lane in a matter of weeks, sent London's Brent North Sea oil rebounding more than 4% in morning deals before trimming gains. The Gulf of Oman lies at the other end of the strategic Strait of Hormuz from the Gulf, part of a vital shipping lane through which at least 15 million barrels of crude oil and hundreds of millions of dollars of non-oil imports pass. According to Iranian state media, one of the tankers, the Norwegian-owned Front Altair was carrying ethanol from Qatar to Taiwan, while the Kokuka Courageous was carrying methanol from Saudi Arabia to Singapore. --AFP--
