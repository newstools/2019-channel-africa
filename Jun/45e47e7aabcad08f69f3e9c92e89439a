This comes against the backdrop of messages that threaten violence and a national shutdown, which Zimbabweans have largely ignored. Police in Bulawayo yesterday held a public campaign assuring residents of their safety while urging them to go about their business without fear as law enforcement agents were on high alert for any security threats. The police used a megaphone to assure people of their security and also used the campaign to alert residents of crimes which include theft and robberies. Their campaign cut across most western suburbs and began shortly after 5am. “Good morning Bulawayo residents, we hereby inform you that you are all safe and should feel free to go about your daily business as we have capable police officers deployed around the city for your safety”. “Those that work, you may go to work and all children must be in school, ignore Whatsapp messages instructing people to stay at home,” said Bulawayo acting spokesperson Inspector Abednico Ncube during the campaign in Tshabalala suburb. In an interview, Inspector Ncube said there was nothing amiss with police conducting the campaign early in the morning. He said it was part of police duties to ensure the public are advised of their security in light of malicious social media messages designed to threaten public peace. --ZimChronicle--
