Kambole joined the Glamour Boys on a three year deal after football manager Bobby Motaung agreed to the deal with Zesco Chief Executive Officer Richard Mulenga. The fee paid is said to be a record for Team Ya Ziko which was said to be $200 000 Â which equates to just under R3 million(). The previous record was when Congolese striker Idris Mbombo was sold to Al Shabaab in 2017. According to reports in Zambia, Kambole will receive a salary of close to R100 000($6.700) a month which will drop slightly after taxes. This figure does not include incentives and bonuses inserted into his contract. The Zambia star is the record-holder for scoring the fastest CAF Champions League hat trick which he managed in five minutes against Swaziland's Mbabane Swallows in 2018.
