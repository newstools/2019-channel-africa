Fowler is the latest American star to confirm his attendance at the third Rolex Series event on the 2019 Race to Dubai, with Justin Thomas and Matt Kuchar joining European Major winners Rory McIlroy and Henrik Stenson in the world-class field. The 2015 Scottish Open champion will be looking to reproduce the stellar form which saw Fowler claim the title just a few miles down the East Lothian coastline at Gullane Golf Club. Fowler has enjoyed a phenomenal run since his debut at the tournament in 2014, securing top ten finishes in all four of his appearances in the event. He has already tasted victory on the PGA Tour in 2019, capturing his ninth career win at the Phoenix Open in March. With the Scottish Open taking its traditional spot in the week before the Open Championship he will be hoping that a strong performance at the Renaissance Club can translate into his first Major title at Royal Portrush Golf Club. "I'm looking forward to returning to Scotland for the Scottish Open. I have great memories from this tournament, particularly of my win at Gullane in 2015, and with fantastic courses and knowledgeable fans, I'm always excited to play," said Fowler. "It's a fun week but it gives the tournament extra edge to have The Open the following week. I know that a lot of players have won The Open after playing in Scotland so itâ€™s good preparation as well as being a great week of competition in itself." The tournament will be played for the first time at The Renaissance Club - which was founded in 2008 and nestles on 300 picturesque acres along the Firth of Forth, when it takes its place as the third event in the 2019 Rolex Series, the premium category of tournaments on the Race to Dubai, each with a minimum prize fund of $7 million. Defending Scottish Open champion Brandon Stone of South Africa and local favourite Russell Knox will also be in the star-studded field.
