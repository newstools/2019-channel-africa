Commission chair, Deputy Chief Justice Raymond Zondo, said on Monday that a task team should be established to investigate why Parliament failed to assist various whistle blowers, who had highlighted urgent cases that needed prosecuting for money laundering. SACP General-Secretary Blade Nzimande says no stone must be left unturned in the fight against State capture and corruption. “One of the biggest challenges we face is actually to defeat what is called State capture and corruption.” “So we welcome the fact that things are coming out of all these commissions and other investigations that have actually come out and even this decision from the Deputy Chief Justice Zondo to actually probe parliament.” “We will support that. If parliament needs to be investigated let it be so because we must leave no stone unturned.”
