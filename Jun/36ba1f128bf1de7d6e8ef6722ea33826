Airlines are now warning of the prospect of flights being disrupted beyond the end of the busy summer period when the grounding of over 300 MAX jets and a delivery halt affecting at least 100 more has caused cancellations and high leasing bills. The 737 MAX was grounded worldwide in March in the wake of two accidents in five months, which prompted Boeing to redesign part of an automated software system suspected of playing a role in the crashes that also involved faulty sensor data. The International Air Transport Association, a body representing some 290 airlines and over 80% of global traffic, said technical requirements and timelines for the safe re-entry to service of the 737 MAX should be aligned. The statement came a day after an IATA summit to discuss the grounding of Boeingâ€™s top-selling passenger jet - the second such meeting held in recent weeks. It also followed news on Wednesday, first reported by Reuters, that the US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) had identified a new risk that Boeing must address on the 737 MAX before it can start flying again. --Reuters--
