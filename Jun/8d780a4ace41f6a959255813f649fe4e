Sudan's ruling generals and an opposition coalition have been wrangling for weeks over what form a transitional government should take after the military deposed and detained long-time President, Omar al-Bashir, on April 11. "We're looking at all options, including sanctions down the line should there be any kind of repeat of violence," Makila James, deputy assistant secretary for East Africa and the Sudanâ€™s, told a US House of Representatives hearing. She said they could include visa sanctions or economic sanctions. "We want to use the right tool and we want to target the right people," James said. Talks between the two sides collapsed when security forces stormed a protest sit-in on June 3, killing dozens and prompting concern from world powers.

James told the House Foreign Affairs Africa subcommittee that Washington believes the best possible outcome in Sudan is an agreement between the military authorities and the opposition Forces for Freedom and Change, or FFC. The State Department appointed a veteran diplomat, Donald Booth, as special envoy for Sudan on June 10. James praised a mediation effort led by Ethiopia and said Washington had made clear "in very strong terms" that a unilateral military government would not be acceptable. The US sanctioned Sudan under Bashir over its alleged support for militant groups and the civil war in Darfur.
