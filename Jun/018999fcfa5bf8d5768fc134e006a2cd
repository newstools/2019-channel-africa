Executives hope improvements the bank has made to its risk management and capital planning processes since failing 2018 test will enable it to achieve a conditional pass this year, the sources said. The sources said their optimism is based on conversations with Fed officials over several months. However, the Fed has yet to give a final decision and the bank’s fourth failure in five years is still possible, they said. A Deutsche Bank spokesperson said: "We cannot confirm any of the information as the results are not known to us. We respect the process, and we will respect the Federal Reserve’s decision, when made." The Federal Reserve implemented annual tests of lenders after the 2008 financial crisis to check whether they have sufficient capital to weather a major economic downturn. Even if the bank passes the stress tests, executives expect the Fed to continue to bar it from making payments to its German parent without the Fed’s approval, the sources said. They also anticipate Deutsche will be told to continue improving the systems it uses to monitor its business and risks, the sources said.
