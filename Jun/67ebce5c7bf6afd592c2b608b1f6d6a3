Hundreds of thousands of people have been displaced within the Democratic Republic of Congo following fighting between the Hema and Lendu groups. New arrivals in Uganda are being screened for Ebola as parts of Ituri have experienced an outbreak of the disease. Preparations have already been put in place because of concerns that people infected with Ebola could cross into Uganda. Between late 2017 and early 2018 tens of thousands of Congolese crossed into Uganda fleeing another spike in violence between the Hema and Lendu communities. "The situation, as we hear it from our colleagues on the ground, is quite dramatic," UNHCR spokesperson Andreas Kirchhoff said. "We have only a sketchy picture because we don't have access to most of these areas. There's too much violence, too much insecurity." About 10% of cases in the Ebola outbreak in eastern DRC have been in Ituri. Last week, Uganda confirmed three cases of people infected with the virus. They had recently travelled from DRC and have since died. --BBC--
