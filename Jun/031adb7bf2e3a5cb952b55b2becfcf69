Switzerland's federal Supreme Court had suspended an IAAF ruling restricting testosterone levels in female runners. This meant Semenya could continue to compete pending a final judgement. However, the IAAF announced it its official website on Tuesday that it had submitted its response to the Swiss Federal Tribunal. The IAAF explained why its disorder of sexual differentiation (DSD) regulations should remain in force following a 'super provisional order' issued by the SFT and received by the IAAF on June 4, 2019. The IAAF specifically requested: Reversal of the order to the IAAF to super-provisionally suspend the implementation of the DSD Regulations in respect of the appellant. Dismissal of the appellant's application to suspend the implementation of the DSD Regulations in respect of the appellant pending the outcome of the appeal. --News24--
