The fixture was originally supposed to take place on Sunday at Coffee's ground in the capital, Addis Ababa. But police said it should be postponed because of tensions between fans. The last time the two teams met in Mekelle, northern Ethiopia, Coffee supporters were attacked and political slogans were displayed in the stadium. Mekelle is the capital of the Tigray region. Since Abiy Ahmed became prime minister in April last year, there have been claims that Tigray, which was once dominant, has become politically marginalised. The football federation now wants the fixture to take place on Thursday behind closed doors in Adama, 100km (62 miles) outside Addis Ababa, Coffee said it will take its complaint to the continent's football governing body, Caf. The Ethiopian football authorities say that Coffee could be penalised if the match does not go ahead. The controversy comes as the Premier League reaches its climax in Ethiopia. Fasil are top of the table with three games to play, but Mekelle are three points behind them and have a game in hand - the postponed fixture. Fasil have sided with Coffee in the row over the rescheduled game. --BBC--
