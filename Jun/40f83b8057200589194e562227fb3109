The move comes after the Trump administration put Huawei on a blacklist last month that barred it from doing business with United States tech companies such as Alphabet Inc, whose Android OS is used in Huawei’s phones. Since then, Huawei - the world’s biggest maker of telecoms network gear - has filed for a Hongmeng trademark in countries such as Cambodia, Canada, South Korea and New Zealand, data from the UN World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) shows. It also filed an application in Peru on May 27, according to the country’s anti-trust agency Indecopi. Huawei has a back-up OS in case it is cut off from US-made software, Richard Yu, CEO of the firm’s consumer division, told German newspaper Die Welt in an interview earlier in 2019. --Reuters--
