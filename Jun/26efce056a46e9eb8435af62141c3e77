‘‘Chairperson of TMC, Lt. Gen. Abdel-Fattah Al-Burhan, for his part, commended Eritrea’s constructive role that stems from good-neighbourly perspectives and Sudan’s readiness to restore warm ties with Eritrea,’‘ tweeted Eritrea’s information minister, Yemane Meskel. The delegation that included Eritrea’s foreign minister, Osman Saleh met leaders of the TMC and the head of the political committee, to express their support for the prevailing transitional arrangement. Sudan’s military on Monday asked that proposals to review a stalemate with protesters, from Ethiopia and the African Union (AU), should be merged. “We have received two separate proposals to study from Ethiopia and another one from the AU. “What we have agreed with both the AU and Ethiopia is one combined proposal to be presented to us, and to narrow gaps between points of view,” these are the words of Shams El Din Kabbashi, spokesperson for Sudan’s military junta. Sudan’s ruling military council calls for joint AU and Ethiopia transition plan, rejecting Ethiopia’s civilian transition proposal Kabbashi had earlier said the Transitional Military Council, TMC, had not even looked at the Ethiopian plan because it was from only one stakeholder. Ethiopian Prime Minister, Abiy Ahmed, was in Khartoum earlier this month after Special Forces forcibly broke up a sit-in killing hundreds and injuring many more. The junta and protest leaders had cut all contact despite Abiy’s envoy managing to secure an agreement for resumption. The protesters have since called for a mediator saying they had lost trust in the TMC. --Reuters--
