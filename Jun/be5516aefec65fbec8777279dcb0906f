He said his administration will rapidly and more effectively respond to legitimate concerns of the general public with regard to tackling corruption head-on by holding the corrupt fully accountable for their misdeeds. The President said this in a speech read on his behalf by Foreign Affairs and International Trade Minister, Sibusiso Moyo, at a two-day Fraud and Corruption Conference, which opened in Harare yesterday. “In parallel with such restitution must, of course, come retribution,” he said. “Those found guilty of such corruption must be sanctioned where they can reflect upon the consequences of their greed and the shame and misfortune that that greed has brought upon themselves and their families.” Mnangagwa said Government has made progress in strengthening existing legislation and introducing extra laws to boost the Second Republic’s anti-corruption drive. Some of the significant amendments that have been made to tighten up mandatory reporting and oversight requirements feature in a number of laws such as the Public Finance Management; Insolvency; Audit; Public Entities Corporate Governance; Companies; Public Procurement and Disposal of Public Assets; and Money Laundering and Proceeds of Crime Acts among others. The Government is also working on a Whistleblower’s Act to encourage and protect those who see evil being done and wish to stop it. Mnangagwa said Government is in the final stages of appointing commissioners to the Anti-Corruption Commission and strengthening the Office of the Prosecutor-General. --Herald--
