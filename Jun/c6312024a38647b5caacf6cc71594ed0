The UN children's agency, UNICEF, says the average school enrolment rate in these areas was just 50%. The majority of those out of school are girls with the states most affected in northern Nigeria. UNICEF says more than 10 million children were unable to access safe education, largely due to an Islamist insurgency in the north-east of Nigeria. Just recently, Unicef also came out to say an estimated 115-million boys and men around the world were married as children. In the first large-scale analysis of data on child grooms, Unicef found that it was prevalent around boys in sub-Saharan Africa, South and East Asia and Latin America.
