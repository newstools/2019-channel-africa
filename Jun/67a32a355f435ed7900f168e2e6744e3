"Cut at the base," says Oluwafemi Kochoni, an organic farming teacher, who runs the agricultural workshop to prepare young people for a future sustainably working the land. "Then leave the plants in place, we will bury them - they will decompose and fertilise the soil." It's beginner's advice but the programme in Tori-Bossito, just outside Benin's economic capital Cotonou, aims to teach basic, traditional ways of agriculture to those who have forgotten or never known a life on the land. In Benin, a poor country next to oil giant Nigeria, some 80% of its 11 million people depend on agriculture, according to the United Nation's Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO). Most are subsistence farmers eking out living growing crops on small plots where a lack of infrastructure and flooding that can wipe out harvests and seed stocks are key challenges, the FAO warns. But the "agro-bootcamps" - the name is borrowed from the intensive training of the US army - take place close to the suburbs of the city and are aimed at a different market. They are part of a wider movement to encourage self-sufficiency on the continent, which has some two-thirds of the world's remaining uncultivated arable land - but spends $64.5 billion a year importing food, according to the African Development Bank. For $45 a week, agro-bootcampers learn agricultural techniques, follow marketing courses and can network with successful agro-entrepreneurs.
