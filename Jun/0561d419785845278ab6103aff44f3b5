It is less than half of the $3.2 billion required by the Mozambican government. The announcement was made by President, Filipe Nyusi, at the International Conference of Donors in the city of Beira on Monday. Beira is one of the areas worst hit by the cyclones. The two-day conference brought together around 700 participants from international organisations, private sectors and civil societies. In his address, Â Nyusi thanked all those who had pledged to help and encouraged everyone to continue raising the remaining amount required for a complete reconstruction. He promised transparency in fund management. --BBC--
