The movement of pigs between farms will be strictly controlled, the Director of Veterinary and Livestock Services, Xolani Dlamini, said in a statement in the Swazi Observer. The disease is highly contagious and fatal among pigs while there is no vaccine against it. It does not affect humans. Dlamini said his office would introduce a system to identify and track pigs. "Importation's are only from slaughter houses and establishments that are located in ASF-free zones and also source their slaughter stock from registered and supervised disease-free compartments," Dlamini said. Last month, South Africa's Department of Agriculture said the outbreak of the disease had spread to a fourth province in the country. China has also been struggling to contain an outbreak of ASF since last year, causing major losses to the world's largest hog-herd. --reuters--
