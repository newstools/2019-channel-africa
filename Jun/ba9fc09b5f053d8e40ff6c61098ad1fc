White shared his views via a column for the All Out Rugby website, responding to the announcement last week that SA Rugby will no longer directly contract Springboks and provincial unions agreeing to a cap on player budgets. White wrote: "Under the new contracting model, SA Rugby is actively telling players to go overseas with no fear that it will affect their chances of playing for the Springboks. "We're going to call Regulation 9 whenever the Test window opens while we're blooding juniors in South Africa on longer term contracts. It's contradictory because all of the values we're going to be trying to instil in those youngsters don’t apply to the more senior players we’ve told to chase big contracts overseas." In a rather radical suggestion, White said SA Rugby as a whole should be put on sale to the highest bidder. --News24--
