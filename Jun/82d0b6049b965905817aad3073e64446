It said the death toll "from the massacre today has risen to nine martyrs, with four new martyrs", since its last statement, the Central Committee of Sudanese Doctors said on its Facebook page. Sudan's military rulers denied trying to break up a protest sit-in "by force". "We did not disperse the sit-in by force," said Shamseddine Kabbashi, Spokesperson for the ruling military council. "The tents are there, and the youth are moving freely," he told Sky News Arabia. --AFP--
