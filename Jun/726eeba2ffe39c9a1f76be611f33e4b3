According to a shareholder notice issued on Monday afternoon, the company's listing on both the JSE and the London Stock Exchange has been suspended. This decision by the board comes following a delay in the publication of the company's financial results. Shareholders were advised on May 31, 2019 that the financial results for March 31, 2018 cannot be relied upon and will be restated. This has had implications for the reliance of the interim results for the period ended September 30, 2018 and the full 12 months ended March 31, 2019. "Owing to the board’s concern that there is insufficient information in the market to enable investors to make informed decisions, the board has voluntarily approached the JSE with a request for a suspension of the listing of the company’s securities. "The JSE has granted this request, and accordingly the listing of the Company’s securities on the JSE has been suspended. The listing of the securities on the London Stock Exchange, on which the company has a secondary listing, has also been suspended," the notice read.
