In an interview with NewsDay, Knowledge Musona states that the team will play attacking forward as they desperately seek maximum points to get their campaign back on track. “We are ready for Uganda. We got some few days to prepare and correct the mistakes we made. It’s looking good, and I hope we will be able to rectify those mistakes, and take the positives and improve on them,” Musona said. The skipper also admitted his mistake which led to a goal against Egypt on Friday cost the team, and will try to correct everything in Uganda’s match. “We are looking forward to the game and will try to do our best to collect maximum points. If you look at that game, it was a mistake I made. But overall, the defence played well, the midfield played well and also the attack, but we need to improve in the final third because we need more action,” said the skipper. --Soccer24--
