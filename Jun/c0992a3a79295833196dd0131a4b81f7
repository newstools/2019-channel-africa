As heads of the world's 20 leading economies began their summit in Osaka, Trump said he was hopeful that Saturday's talks would be "productive". Global equities have enjoyed a largely positive couple of weeks on hopes for progress in the head-to-head meeting between the leaders of the world's top two economies, though the possibility of failure persists. Traders were biding their time on Friday, with London's main FTSE 100 index drifting 0.2% higher in afternoon trading. Paris added Â 0.4% and Frankfurt rose 0.6%. Wall Street opened higher, with the Dow gaining 0.4%. The mood in Asia was more downbeat with Shanghai ending down 0.6% and Tokyo and Hong Kong each off 0.3%. The dollar was down slightly against main rivals, while sterling did not react to official data confirming that Britain's Brexit-facing economy grew by 0.5% in the first quarter. Saturday's Trump-Xi "meeting is hugely important as the trade war represents arguably the greatest threat to the global economy, especially if it is allowed to escalate further", Craig Erlam, senior analyst at Oanda trading group, told AFP. There remains some uncertainty about how the meeting will go, with the Wall Street Journal reporting that Xi plans to demand the US reverse a ban on doing business with Chinese telecoms giant Huawei as a condition for kick starting talks. Trade war talks had stalled last month when Trump hiked tariffs on some Chinese goods. --AFP--
