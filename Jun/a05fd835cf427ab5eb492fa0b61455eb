Uganda imposed a 10 % excise duty on manufactured goods from Kenya making them relatively expensive in its market and uncompetitive against local products. Pwani Oil has a range of products including soaps and oils introduced last year in December that are specifically meant for Uganda, but the trade barriers have seen sales almost halve. Company commercial director Rajul Malde said before the tariff the firm used to sell four truckloads of soaps worth $140 000 but this has so far slumped to $70 000 since the excise duty came into effect in April. “The 10 % duty has become an impediment to our products that destined for Ugandan market and this is something that needs to be addressed because it is affecting our business in that country,” said Malde. “The duty has made our products to the country 10 % more expensive than the locally produced ones hence creating unfavourable climate for competition. --BusinessNation--
