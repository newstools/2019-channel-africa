She finished in a time of five minutes 38.19 just 0.12 seconds outside the South Africa record set by Zola Budd 28 years ago. It was Semenya’s first race since she filed an appeal against the Court of Arbitration for Sports ruling allowing the International Association of Athletics Federations to implement the rules limiting the level of testosterone in certain athletes. She was named in the preliminary South African squad for the World Champs this week, but made it clear after last night’s race she’s determined to compete. Semenya says, "I can run any events I want. It can be 100 metres, it can be 200, it can be long jump, it can be heptathlon, you name it, you know. I am a talented athlete. So, I’m not worried about anything else. Even if I have to withdraw from 800 metres, it doesn’t matter no more. I think I’ve won anything I ever wanted." --SABC--
