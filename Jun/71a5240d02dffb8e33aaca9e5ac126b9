Laboratory results from the blood samples of a 36-year-old patient who was taken into isolation on Sunday were negative for Ebola. Her husband and two other contacts had also been quarantined. Health workers in the south-western town of Kericho say they acted out of caution in isolating the patient. She had a fever, headache, sore throat and was vomiting - symptoms that would indicate the presence of a number of infections, including Ebola. Meanwhile, specialists in global public health say the persistence of the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC)'s Ebola outbreak and its deadly spread to Uganda in recent days show how societal issues are as crucial as scientific advances in controlling disease outbreaks. Medical scientists, prompted by a devastating West African Ebola epidemic between 2013 and 2016, have worked fast to develop cutting edge vaccines, treatments and antibody-based therapies they hoped would prevent or halt future outbreaks of the virus. That includes an Ebola vaccine developed by Merck &Co Inc that proved more than 95% effective in clinical trials. But the current Ebola outbreak has continued to spread relentlessly since it began in August 2018 in DRC's North Kivu province. It has infected more than 2,000 people, killing at least 1 400 of them. In recent days, it reached Uganda, where several cases have been recorded, all in people who had come across the border from Congo.
