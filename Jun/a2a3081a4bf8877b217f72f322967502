This is the biggest year-on-year percentage change in the volume of manufacturing production since June 2016. At 4.6%, the annual growth was far above the projections of analysts, who expected a rise in the region of 1%. Stats SA reported that increases in the production of iron and steel, metals and machinery; as well as motor vehicles, parts and accessories contributed to the 4.6% rise. Production increased by 2.8% in April over March. Last week, figures released by the Pretoria-based national statistical agency showed that SA's gross domestic product fell by 3.2% in the first three months of the year, its biggest drop in ten years. --News24--
