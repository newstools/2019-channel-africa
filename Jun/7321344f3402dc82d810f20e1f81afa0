Unilever, which makes household goods ranging from Dove soaps to Knorr packet soups, reported a 5% jump in emerging market sales in its latest reported quarter, compared to a 0.3% rise in its big developed markets.

The combination of quite a big population, strong GDP growth and rapid consumption in the categories we sell means that countries like Vietnam, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Myanmar and even Ethiopia will be our growth stars over the next few years,"Jope told the Deutsche Bank Global Consumer conference in Paris.

"These are going to be very important for the future and we are investing heavily," he said. The company already gets 58% of its sales from emerging markets including China, India and Brazil.
