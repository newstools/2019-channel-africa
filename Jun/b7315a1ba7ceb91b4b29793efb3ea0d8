Outside the square, thousands lined the streets to watch the funeral procession. The mass funeral in January 2018 for members of the Tiv farming community - who had died in violent clashes with semi-nomadic herders - was a painful reminder that fighting over farmland and grazing has been happening with devastating regularity in central Nigeria’s Benue state. As climate change brings harsher and longer droughts, northern Nigerian pastoralists have been pushed further south in search of grazing for their animals, said Israel Okpe of the local non-profit Pastoral Resolve, which works to assist pastoralist groups. But farmed areas also are expanding, leaving far less open grazing land available for pastoralists, and leading to herds more frequently straying into crops. To try to stop conflicts, state officials in 2017 instituted a law prohibiting the long-held practice of herders grazing their animals on any open land. Supporters of the legislation say it is needed to help protect the livelihoods of farmers already struggling with recurring drought. But critics say livestock are also a key part of the country’s economy - and restricting age-old pastoralist practice will leave herders with only bad options: stay in Benue and break the law, travel to a nearby state and risk clashing with farmers there, or watch their animals die.
