The case of Peter Biar Ajak, a former child refugee who returned to his native South Sudan as an internationally renowned academic, has thrown the spotlight on what rights groups say is repression of dissent in Africa’s youngest country. Biar fled to the United States as a youth, was educated at Harvard and Cambridge and worked at the World Bank. He became South Sudan country director for the International Growth Centre, part of the London School of Economics. Biar was arrested in July, 2018 and charged with treason, although a court threw out those charges in April. He had been publicly critical of the way President Salva Kiir and rebel leader Riek Machar approached peace talks to end the civil war. Biar’s lawyer said they would appeal his conviction for inciting public violence through speech. "The decision itself is in conflict with the constitution especially freedom of expression," he told Reuters. "Peter Biar has been convicted for speaking to VOA (Voice of America) Radio."
