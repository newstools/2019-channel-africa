Defence Minister Sheriff Sy said an "armed terrorist group" carried out the assault on Tuesday night in the district of Tongomayel. He said a massive military operation was under way to secure the area. There have been numerous recent attacks in northern Burkina Faso, many carried out by jihadists. There have also been ethnic clashes. Earlier this month, 19 people villagers were killed in the neighbouring district of Arbinda. --BBC--
