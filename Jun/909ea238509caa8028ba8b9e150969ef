Away from hustle and bustle on London living, the South Africans can treat this week as a fresh start. They have two games at the Rose Bowl, India on Wednesday and then West Indies on Monday - in what is shaping up to be a massive week in their World Cup campaign. The good news from Tuesday was that Hashim Amla enjoyed a long net session and looks to be fully recovered from the knock to the head he suffered against England last week. Confirmation on his availability will only come later on Tuesday, but the signs are that he will be ready to go. The obvious area of concern is in the fast bowling department. Lungi Ngidi was at the ground briefly on Tuesday morning but left before the intensity of the session picked up. He is out of the India clash with a hamstring strain. Dale Steyn, meanwhile, was not very involved at all and was ruled out of the World Cup soon after the session ended. He played the customary game of pre-training soccer, but sat out of the fielding session that followed and did not join the seamers when they had a bowling session with coach Ottis Gibson. It left Kagiso Rabada, Chris Morris, Andile Phehlukwayo and Dwaine Pretorius as the four seamers working with Gibson. The coach was surprised at the lack of yorkers South Africa bowled against Bangladesh on Sunday, and that was clearly a work-on for Tuesday. While spinners Imran Tahir and Tabraiz Shamsi bowled to the batsmen in one net, the four seamers bowled at a target on yorker length over and over again. India's batting line-up, led by the devastating Virat Kohli, has the ability to go big and preventing runs at the death is clearly an area where South Africa know they have to improve after conceding 54 runs in the final 4 overs of Bangladesh's innings.Â
