The jihadists, armed with rocket launchers, attacked military positions on Darak, an island near Lake Chad in Cameroon's Far North region. "As of today, we have 21 military and 16 civilian fatalities," the source said. An earlier toll said at least 26 people, 17 soldiers and nine civilians had died, in one of the deadliest attacks in Cameroon by the Nigerian-based group. Fierce fighting broke out with the soldiers, which included the Cameroonian army and troops from the Multinational Joint Task Force, a five-nation anti-jihadist mission. The assailants succeeded in raising their black flag before being repelled. Around 40 assailants were captured, another security source said. "More bodies have been recovered from the water," a source said. Most of the military fatalities were sailors who had been sent to the Lake Chad region as part of the fight against Boko Haram, he said. Boko Haram has led a decade-long uprising to establish a hard-line Islamic state in Nigeria's northeast, killing more than 27,000 people and leaving 1.8 million homeless. The insurgency has spilled into the Lake Chad region, the crossroads between Nigeria, Niger, Chad and Cameroon, inflicting heavy loss of life, mass displacement and economic damage. --AFP--
