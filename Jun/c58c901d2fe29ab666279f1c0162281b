ICTU was addressing a media briefing in Johannesburg, South Africa. MultiChoice is set on retrenching 1790 workers and has served its employees with letters of retrenchment, a Section189, on Friday. The pay-tv operator wants to dismiss staff at its call centres and walk-in offices. The ICTU says it has a ten step program to address retrenchments. It says there is no economic reason to retrench. MultiChoice announced its financial results earlier in June and it posted a profit of R50 billion. The company says a changing digital environment has prompted the changes. It says call centres and walk-in centres are becoming obsolete as people prefer self-service. ICTU has given the operator until Tuesday to respond to its demands not retrench. The union says if the corporation fails to do so, it will make an urgent application in the Labour Court on Wednesday.
