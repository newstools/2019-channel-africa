Ossufo Momade became Renamo's head last year following the death Alfonso Dhlakama, who led the group during Mozambique's 16-year civil war. Some members accuse Momade of sidelining Frelimo members. He is expected to register to run in October's presidential elections. Correspondents say the divisions within Renamo are a serious threat to the peace process and could undermine the election. --BBC--
