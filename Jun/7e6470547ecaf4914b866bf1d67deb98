The lawyer said consequences could also include loss of bail, but did not give further details.

"In Japan we just don't know what terrible thing will happen next, not just limited to rearrests," one of his lawyers, Junichiro Hironaka, told reporters outside his office. The Japanese government’s chief spokesman Yoshihide Suga has said that Ghosn is being treated in accordance with Japanese law. Hironaka cancelled the briefing at the Foreign Correspondents' Club of Japan (FCCJ) only two hours after journalists were informed of the event. Had it gone ahead, Ghosn would have spoken as Japanese PrimeMinister Shinzo Abe hosted national leaders at the G20 leaders gathering in Osaka, including US President Donald Trump and French President Emmanuel Macron. Ghosn's wife Carole has called on Macron to raise the issue of her husband's treatment in Japan. Japanese courts have dismissed appeals by Ghosn to ease a bail restriction that bans him from contacting his wife. His lawyers have argued that that condition violates Japan’s constitution and international law on family separations. Hironaka said the decision to hold the press conference on Friday came after Ghosn's latest attempt to seek court permission for a one-off meeting with his wife failed, and was unrelated to the timing of the G20. --Reuters--
