United States Attorney, Reed Brody, of Human Rights Watch (HRW), says Jammeh treated Gambian women like his personal property.Â "Rape and sexual assault are crimes, and Jammeh is not above the law, and no woman is beneath it." Jammeh ruled the tiny West African state for 22 years before fleeing to Equatorial Guinea after losing elections to opposition candidate Adama Barrow in December 2016. His regime was notorious for its brutality and corruption, but this is the first time that his sexual abuse of women has been extensively and publicly documented. The investigation, by HRW and a Swiss NGO, TRIAL international, is based on evidence from several women, eight former Gambian officials and several other witnesses, they said. Jammeh had "protocol girls" who were required to be on call to provide him with sex, according to their report, issued in Dakar, the capital of neighbouring Senegal. He "handpicked young women to satisfy his sexual fantasies," according to a top aide quoted in the report. As an inducement, he would lavish gifts on them or provide support for their impoverished families or offer a scholarship to study abroad. They were required to live next to his residence and were barred from leaving without his authorisation and if they refused his sexual demands, he would threaten them or hit them. The "protocol girls" were overseen by his female cousin, Jimbee Jammeh, who also procured other women for him, the report said. She fled with him to Equatorial Guinea. Several women have gone on record with their experiences, it said.
