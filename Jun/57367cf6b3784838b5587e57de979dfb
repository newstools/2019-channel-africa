The left-hander completed his 15 one-day international hundred in Taunton when an outside edge off Shaheen Shah Afridi flew past Asif Ali at slip for his 11 four. He reached his hundred off 102 balls, including one six. A joyful Warner took off his helmet and leapt in the air to celebrate a century that left reigning champions Australia on course for a big total. He was out shortly afterwards, caught at deep point by Imam-ul-Haq off the bowling of Afridi for 107. Warner, 32, has enjoyed a successful return to official international cricket at the World Cup, hitting 89 not out against Afghanistan and 56 against India. Neither Warner nor former Australia captain Steve Smith, also returning from a year-long ball-tampering ban, were booed after being jeered by spectators in previous matches as Pakistan supporters heeded a plea from skipper Sarfaraz Ahmed to leave the pair alone. --AFP--
