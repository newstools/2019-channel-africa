In an interview with Belgian media in Brussels, where he was attending the European Development Days summit (EDD 2019), Kagame said: “People fear fighting between us. I don’t see it coming because I think Uganda understands the cost of it. We don’t want to go down that road because everyone will lose something.” Since late February, Rwanda has blocked its citizens from travelling to Uganda and restricted Ugandan goods from crossing the border. Kagame said Uganda had been arresting Rwandans and supporting rebel groups opposed to his government. “We have seen Uganda getting involved in supporting groups against us because they think we don’t stand for the interests of Uganda. We see people being arrested in Uganda,” he said. Ugandan officials have denied these claims. --TheEastAfrican--
