The broadcaster announced that it would be retrenching workers to keep up with economic and technological developments.Â 

Most of those who could be retrenched work at call centres and customer care facilities. CWU's Secretary General, Aubrey Tshabalala, says they want to make sure everything has been done to save jobs.

The Information and Communications Technology Union (ICTU) on Monday said it has a ten step program to address retrenchments. It said there is no economic reason for retrenchment. MultiChoice announced its financial results earlier in June and it posted a profit of R50 billion. The company said a changing digital environment has prompted the changes.
