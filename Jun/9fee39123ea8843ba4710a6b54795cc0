The group said the extension was approved by the requisite majorities of Steinhoff Europe AG (SEAG) and Steinhoff Finance Holding GmbH (SFHG) creditors last Thursday. Steinhoff has been racing against time to implement its financial restructuring plans for its subsidiaries after it entered into a company voluntary arrangement (CVA) in December last year. The latest request for extension follows the two earlier ones launched by the group in December and in March. The last one was launched on May 17. “Following extensive discussions between the company, advisers to the SEAG creditors group and the SFHG creditors group, the company launched CVA consent request No 3. CVA consent request No 3. was approved by the requisite majorities of SEAG and SFHG creditors on May 30, 2019,” Steinhoff said on Friday. Despite the thumbs-up from the creditors, the group's share price continued to trade in a negative territory on Friday as it closed weaker at R1.34 a share. --AfricaNews--
