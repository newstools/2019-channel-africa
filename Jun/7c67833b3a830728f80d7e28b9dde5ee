The group of 76 men, women and children were hounded out of the camp in April in the wake of being targeted because of their sexual orientation. They went to find safety in the Kenyan capital, Nairobi, but were also victimised there. On Wednesday evening, without warning, two buses arrived outside where they were staying to take them back to Kakuma. In a statement, the UNHCR says "upon their arrival, the refugees will be met by UNHCR Kakuma protection teams. "Each refugee will be individually counselled and their protection needs will be evaluated and appropriate action taken for each of them. "Special provisions will be made for refugees with particular needs and vulnerabilities, including those with the LGBTI profile." --BBC--
