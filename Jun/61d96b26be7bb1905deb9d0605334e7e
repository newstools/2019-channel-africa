According to Norwegian TV2, Terje Skeie, who stands 1.96m (6ft 5in) tall, stepped into Monday's free-kick training to play the role of the 1.87m-tall centre-back Renard, who scored two headed goals in France's opening 4-0 victory over South Korea. "He looks like her, no? We even thought about putting a wig on him," Norway coach Martin Sjoegren joked of Skeie. Joking aside, Sjoegren predicted that his team would offer up more resistance than the South Koreans. "We have players who are better headers of the ball than South Korea and we are better one-on-one. "We know there'll be a threat, but at least we have a plan for our defence on free-kicks." Sjoergren added that Renard -- the tournament's tallest player -- was the "biggest threat, but not the sole threat". As for press officer Skeie, he remained modest about his abilities. "I have what it takes height-wise, and even more," he told TV2. "But I think they'll have more trouble stopping her (Renard) than me in training."
