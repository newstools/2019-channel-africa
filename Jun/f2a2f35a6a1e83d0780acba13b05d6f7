According to diplomatic letters seen by The Standard newspaper, Kenya is building a border fence which it has accused Somalia of obstructing "continuously". Last month, three Somali politicians were denied entry to Kenya. It was only in March that Kenya and Somalia had restored diplomatic relations, following a row over the ownership of offshore oil fields. This map, tweeted some while ago by Deutsche Welle, gives a clear picture of the disputed maritime territory: In February, Somalia's ambassador to Kenya had been expelled following reports that Somalia was auctioning off oil fields in a contested area. Somalia denied it was selling the blocks, and has taken Kenya to the International Court of Justice over the issue, which has yet to be resolved. --BBC--
