This comes ahead of their 2019 Fifa Women’s World Cup group match against China on Thursday. Semenya has been in France for athletics purpose, where she took the first place in 2000-metres race at the Montreuil athletics on Tuesday night. The 29-year-old says the reason for her visit was  to give Banyana moral support. The South African women’s team lost their opening game against Spain last Saturday and currently sits at the bottom of Group B. Semenya says the girls can still do better  going forward.
