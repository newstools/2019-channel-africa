Fears of a conflict in the crude-rich Middle East ratcheted up Thursday when Tehran said it had shot down a US "spy drone" that was violating its airspace, which Washington denied. Donald Trump described the move as a "big mistake", adding: "This country will not stand for it". The news which comes a week after the US accused Iran of attacking two tankers in the Gulf of Oman, sent oil prices soaring more than 6% Thursday, while talk has increased of a military stand-off that could deal a massive blow to supplies. Observers said the cost of crude could continue to rise. "If we meld supply risk fear, a powerfully bullish narrative, (the Federal Reserve's) willingness to execute a pro-cyclical rate cut juicing risk assets and frame it with the potentially game-changing G20, you have the makings of a solid base for oil to shoot even higher," said Stephen Innes, managing partner at Vanguard Markets. The focus is also on next week's planned meeting between Trump and his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping on the side-lines of the G20 in Japan next week. Trump's tweet about "a very good telephone conversation" between the pair this week fuelled a surge across global markets on hopes for a deal to end their countries' long-running trade war that has impacted the world economy. However, Asia took a step back Friday, having been given an extra boost by the Fed indicating it will begin to cut interest rates soon, and other central banks erring towards softer monetary policies. --AFP--
