Johnson, vying with foreign secretary Jeremy Hunt to replace outgoing premier Theresa May, insisted her divorce deal struck with the bloc but repeatedly rejected by MPs was "basically dead". The ex-London mayor told a radio phone-in that Britain must "get ready to come out without an agreement" and the European Union should match his plan not to impose any tariffs under such a scenario. "It would be very bizarre if the European Union should decide on their own, we wouldn't put up tariffs -- to impose tariffs on goods coming from the United Kingdom," he told LBC talk radio. "It wouldn't be in the interests of their businesses, let alone their consumers. "It would be a return to Napoleon's continental system," he added, invoking the 19th-century French emperor who attempted to blockade Britain in the Napoleonic Wars. During the radio phone-in, former foreign secretary Johnson delved further into his Brexit strategy if he were to be elected Conservative leader and therefore prime minister by party members next month. The 55-year-old said he wants to "take the serviceable bits" of May's withdrawal agreement, while scrapping the "backstop" provision hated by ardent Brexiteers intended to keep the Irish border open. Johnson said he would withhold paying the EU Britain's $50 billion bill while the two sides negotiate a free trade agreement during an implementation period prolonging current terms. However European leaders have vowed they will not allow London to cherry-pick only the parts of the divorce deal it likes, and that the backstop must remain in place. --AFP--
