The ruling could prompt the United States to bar one of China's largest banks from the US financial system, the Washington Post report said. The order did not explicitly identify the banks but details in the case matched those of three large state-backed Chinese banks: the Bank of Communications, China Merchants Bank and Shanghai Pudong Development Bank, the Post reported. Shares of the Bank of Communications slipped 3.02%, China Merchants Bank fell 4.82% and Shanghai Pudong Development Bank sank 3.08%. The banks did not comply with US subpoenas for information in an investigation into North Korea sanctions violations, the Post reported. The order could allow the US attorney general or Treasury secretary to cut off Shanghai Pudong Development Bank's access to dollars, crucial for its ability to operate globally, the report said. Chinese bank shares led the broader stock market down on Tuesday as investors fretted the latest US broadside against China could imperil trade talks between US President Donald Trump and Chinese leader Xi Jinping at the upcoming G20 summit in Japan. --AFP--
