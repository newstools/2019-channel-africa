The company has demanded that Verizon pay licensing fees for more than 230 of the telecoms equipment maker’s patents and is seeking over $1 billion, a person has told Reuters, against a background of mounting US-China trade tensions. Republican Senator Marco Rubio has described Huawei’s demand as "baseless" and filed the legislation as an amendment to the National Defense Authorization Act, or NDAA, which places a broad ban on the use of US federal money to buy Huawei products citing national security concerns. "We simply don’t believe Marco Rubio’s amendment could be passed as law," Huawei’s chief legal officer, Song Liuping, said at the company’s Shenzhen headquarters on Thursday. Intellectual property (IP) rights "should not be politicized", Song said. "IP is a private property issue and should be free from the competition, trade talks and any other allegations that countries have between them." --Reuters--
