Chinese President Xi Jinping pledged $60 billion to African nations at a China-Africa summit on cooperation in September, matching the size of funds offered at the previous summit in Johannesburg in 2015. Beijing has denied engaging in "debt trap diplomacy" and Xi said in September government debt from Chinese interest-free loans due by the end of the year would be written off for the poorest African nations. Chinese State Councillor Wang Yi told foreign and other ministers from some 50 African countries in Beijing his country does not pursue selfish geopolitical gains in Africa and would never impose its will on others. He said Chinaâ€™s approach to cooperation with Africa had been different to that of traditional powers. "For some time, however, some outside forces have tried to vilify and undermine China-Africa cooperation by cooking up (accusations of) so-called neo-colonialism and debt traps, which are totally groundless and are not accepted by African people," Wang said. "Such attempts expose a total lack of respect for Africa, lack of understanding about China, absence of knowledge about the true friendship between China and Africa that has stood the test of time," he said. --Reuters--
