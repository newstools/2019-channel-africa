The aim is to have 90% of the population know their status, 90% of those found to be HIV positive put on treatment, and at least 90% of those on treatment achieve viral load suppression. 

MSF - together with the KwaZulu-Natal Provincial Health Department in South Africa - achieved this target with their community-based project - Bending The Curves -  in Eshowe. 

They made this announcement at the 2019 South Africa AIDS Conference in Durban. Samkelisiwe Gumede reports.. --SABC--
