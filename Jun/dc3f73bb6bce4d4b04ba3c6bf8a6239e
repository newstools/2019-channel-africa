Eritrea's Information Ministry in a June 5 statement titled: AU stance may exacerbate the situation in the Sudan, blamed the body for what it said was internationalising the crisis. Eritrea has tasked the AU to have a hands on approach in Sudan and do better than it has done so far. A delegation was sent by President Afwerki to Khartoum last month with a firm promise that the Sudanese people had the support of Eritrea. The delegation met with leaders of the military junta and with the protest leaders separately. --AfricaNews--
