The Englishman was the defending champion in Germany and stood a great chance of a repeat victory heading into the final round, but endured a frustrating, error-filled day to see his hopes dashed. While his clubs got plenty of abuse for not doing what he wanted them to, Wallace also seemed all too willing to take his frustrations out on his caddie Dave McNeilly. The 29-year-old first let McNeilly have it on the par-3 12th after he overshot the green from the tee. He would end up bogeying the hole to drop out of a share of the lead. Wallace was still in with a chance of forcing a play-off with a birdie at the par-5 18th, but his chances were sunk when he found the water off the tee. Afterwards, Wallace once again let his caddie have it, and even though the cameras didn't pick up exactly what was said, it was about as much as some viewers could take. Many of them took to twitter to slam Wallace's "disgusting" behaviour, with one user labelling the Race to Dubai leader an "absolute Grade A bellend."
