The new proposal calls for a civilian-majority ruling council as demanded by protesters, but it fails to mention the make-up of a new transitional parliament. "The Alliance for Freedom and Change received the draft and will be considering the proposal to make a decision," the umbrella group said in a statement. The move comes after Sudan's ruling generals urged mediators from the AU and Ethiopia to unify their efforts and come up with a joint proposal on the country's transition. It entails creating a 15-member, civilian-majority governing body for a three-year transitional period. But it makes no mention of the composition of a legislative body. An earlier proposal drafted by Ethiopia had stipulated a transitional parliament of 300 lawmakers, with 67% of them from the Alliance for Freedom and Change, which has spearheaded months-long protests that resulted in the removal of Sudan's long-time leader Omar al-Bashir in April. The remaining 33% were to be from other political groups, excluding now ousted leader al-Bashir's defunct National Congress Party. --News24--
