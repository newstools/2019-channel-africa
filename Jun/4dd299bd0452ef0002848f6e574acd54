From being a food-deficit country, India has achieved the distinction of being a top exporter of food but to retain that edge it needs to revive its reservoirs, lakes and other traditional water bodies, Gajendra Singh Shekhawat said in a statement. "Judicious use of water can save India from future calamities," Shekhawat said. India, a leading producer of an array of food commodities, is sitting on large stockpiles of rice, wheat and sugar. It emerged as the worldâ€™s biggest rice exporter in 2012, selling nearly 12 million tonnes of the staple annually on the world market, including 4 million tonnes of the aromatic basmati variety, exclusively grown in India and Pakistan. But rice is a water intensive crop. Government research bodies and experts say Indian farmers need 4 500 to 5000 litres of water to grow one kg of rice. Water is typically scarce in the summer months, but the situation has been particularly grim this year in western and southern states that received below average rainfall in the 2018 monsoon season. --Reuters--
