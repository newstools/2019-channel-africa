The former foreign minister is the favourite among ten candidates vying to succeed Theresa May, who is stepping down after twice delaying Britain's departure from the European Union. At a launch event packed with senior members of the ruling Conservative party, he insisted Brexit must happen on October 31, the latest deadline agreed with Brussels, but failed to provide detail on how this could happen. He said Britain must prepare to leave with no new arrangements but softened his previous rhetoric, suggesting that this was "a last resort, not something that anybody desires". He also avoided a question about his drug use when a student and dismissed criticism about past comments that have provoked offence among women, ethnic minorities and gay people, saying voters wanted plain-speaking politicians. In a sign of how difficult parliament could make life for Johnson if he became prime minister, a cross-party group of lawmakers on Wednesday launched a bid to block a future "no deal". The EU meanwhile has reiterated it will not renegotiate the divorce terms, but Johnson said a new government with "a new optimism" could help find a way through. He did not repeat his previous threat to withhold the multi-billion-euro payment May agreed to cover Britain's EU liabilities. --AFP--
