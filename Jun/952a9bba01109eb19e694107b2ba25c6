The new proposal calls for a civilian-majority ruling council as demanded by protesters, but it fails to mention the make-up of a new transitional parliament. “The Alliance for Freedom and Change received the draft and will be considering the proposal to make a decision,” the umbrella group said in a statement. The move comes after Sudan’s ruling generals urged mediators from the AU and Ethiopia to unify their efforts and come up with a joint proposal on the country’s transition. It entails creating a 15-member, civilian-majority governing body for a three-year transitional period. But it makes no mention of the composition of a legislative body. An earlier proposal drafted by Ethiopia had stipulated a transitional parliament of 300 lawmakers, with 67 % of them from the Alliance for Freedom and Change. The remaining 33 % were to be from other political groups, excluding now ousted long time ruler Omar al-Bashir defunct National Congress Party. Kabbashi had earlier said the Transitional Military Council, TMC, had not even looked at the Ethiopian plan because it was from only one stakeholder. Ethiopian Prime Minister, Abiy Ahmed, was in Khartoum earlier this month after Special Forces forcibly broke up a sit-in killing hundreds and injuring many more. The junta and protest leaders had cut all contact despite Abiy’s envoy managing to secure an agreement for resumption. The protesters have since called for a mediator saying they had lost trust in the TMC. --AfricaNews--
