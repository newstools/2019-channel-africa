A median forecast from 24 economists, polled this week, suggests the economy will grow 0.6% this year, slower than last year’s 0.8% and weaker than the 1.1% predicted in a May poll. Growth is expected to accelerate next year to 1.4%. Economists reckon this year’s slow growth should be enough to convince authorities to cut interest rates by 25 basis points to 6.50%. Ten of 18 economists predicted rates would be cut in one of next quarter’s two policy meetings, July or September, a substantial uptick in expectations for lower rates. In May, only two people forecast rate cuts. --Reuters--
