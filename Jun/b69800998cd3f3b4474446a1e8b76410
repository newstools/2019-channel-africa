The burial was attended by members of the family in Cairo’s Nasr City after authorities refused burial in Morsi’s home province of Sharqiya, Ahmed Morsi said. Morsi died on Monday from a heart attack after collapsing in a Cairo court while on trial on espionage charges, authorities and a medical source said. --Reuters--
