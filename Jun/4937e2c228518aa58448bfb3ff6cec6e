At least 13 protesters were killed and scores of others injured as Sudanese security forces moved in to clear the main protest camp near the army headquarters in Khartoum. In a press release by the AU Commission, Chairperson, Moussa Faki Mahamat, called for an “immediate and transparent investigation in order to hold those all responsible accountable.” He also called on the Transitional Military Council (TMC) to protect the civilians from further harm. The pan-African body issued a communique on April 30, demanding that all Sudanese stakeholders urgently return to the negotiations that should lead to formation of a civilian-led Transitional Authority. “The Chairperson calls on all international partners to reinforce common efforts towards the immediate cessation of the violence and rapid resumption of negotiations for a political settlement,” the press release said. Faki urged all concerned to “exercise utmost restraint and to respect the rights of citizens, in the interest of the country and its people.” In early April, Sudan’s military establishment deposed President Omar al-Bashir following months of popular demonstrations against his 30-year rule. The TMC is now overseeing a two-year transitional period during which it has pledged to hold presidential elections. Demonstrators, however, have remained on the streets to demand that the TMC relinquish power, at the earliest possible date, to a civilian authority. -- AnadoluAgency--
