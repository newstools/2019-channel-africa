The return of the firms, Gomba, Iftra, Marine and Agro and Ngege is expected to add some 330 000 tons of fish and fish products to the local market and boost exports which have declined over the years. Uganda exports fish to Europe, Australia, the Middle East, US, Egypt and Southeast Asia. In 2017, Uganda exported 14 248 tons of fish valued at $136 million, but a year later, after implementing the stringent measures, the volumes rose to 2 064 tons valued at $153 million. The measures include kicking out foreigners from its water bodies, registering fishing boats that have appropriate gear, implementing closed fishing in breeding areas to allow fingerlings to grow, and establishing aqua-culture and cage fishing. --TheEastAfrican--
