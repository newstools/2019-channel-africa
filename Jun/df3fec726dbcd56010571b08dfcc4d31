AFP reports Foreign Ministry spokesperson Ahmed Hafez as saying he condemned the UN's suggestion "in the strongest terms" and insisted it was "a case of natural death". Egypt's 67-year-old former leader was buried on Tuesday, a day after he collapsed during a court appearance on Monday and died. Morsi was the country's first democratically elected president but had been in custody since his removal by the military in 2013. His family had long raised concerns over his treatment in prison and say that the authorities refused a request for him to be buried in his home town. --BBC--
